00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:17.328
What is this now?

00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:21.527
Wait.

00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:23.527
Isn't it the decoy mechanism

00:03:23.527 --> 00:03:25.127
described in my grandpa's notes

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:26.768
designed to scare people off?

00:03:30.448 --> 00:03:31.527
Well... Miss Fairy,

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:33.967
mind if I borrow your friend's knife?

00:03:34.768 --> 00:03:35.768
I won't touch you.

00:03:44.087 --> 00:03:44.608
Go.

00:04:48.168 --> 00:04:49.327
Didn't attack me?

00:04:50.007 --> 00:04:51.088
It isn't a decoy mechanism.

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:03.168
Sir,

00:05:05.048 --> 00:05:06.488
I never touched your wife.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.488
I'll think of something, okay?

00:05:09.807 --> 00:05:10.887
Just give me more time.

00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:40.247
Pangzi! Pangzi!

00:05:40.728 --> 00:05:41.807
Who's calling me?

00:05:46.687 --> 00:05:47.567
Young man,

00:05:47.687 --> 00:05:48.567
it's you.

00:05:49.168 --> 00:05:50.247
Hurry. Find a way

00:05:50.408 --> 00:05:51.687
to get me down!

00:05:52.608 --> 00:05:53.648
What're you doing?

00:05:53.744 --> 00:05:54.887
Flirting during a crisis?

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:56.088
Keep out of it.

00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:57.648
Help me pry her off.

00:05:59.127 --> 00:06:00.088
Get me down first

00:06:00.088 --> 00:06:01.127
before I can help you.

00:06:02.887 --> 00:06:04.048
Hurry! Hurry up!

00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:05.767
- Wait.
- My blood pressure's spiking.

00:06:06.968 --> 00:06:08.367
I'll throw this up. Catch it.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:09.648
Great! Great!

00:06:09.648 --> 00:06:10.408
One, two, three.

00:06:10.408 --> 00:06:11.207
No, no!

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:12.327
Stop!

00:06:12.528 --> 00:06:13.447
My stance's wrong.

00:06:13.447 --> 00:06:14.408
Let me adjust.

00:06:16.807 --> 00:06:17.887
Okay.

00:06:17.887 --> 00:06:19.048
One, two, three.

00:06:19.048 --> 00:06:19.848
No good!

00:06:19.848 --> 00:06:21.127
Wait. I'm not ready.

00:06:22.168 --> 00:06:23.327
Let me count.

00:06:23.488 --> 00:06:24.168
Come on.

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:25.247
One.

00:06:26.207 --> 00:06:28.088
Two.

00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:29.567
Three!

00:06:31.327 --> 00:06:32.408
Great.

00:06:33.007 --> 00:06:33.648
Wait.

00:06:39.928 --> 00:06:40.928
Are you okay, Pangzi?

00:06:41.728 --> 00:06:43.288
What kind of place is this?

00:06:45.367 --> 00:06:46.567
It hurts.

00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:48.048
I'm not okay.

00:06:49.288 --> 00:06:50.807
This looks like an altar.

00:06:51.168 --> 00:06:53.048
We've been dragged
to the center of the kiln.

00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:55.288
We need to find a way to escape.

00:06:55.528 --> 00:06:56.648
Too many ghost hands here.

00:06:56.648 --> 00:06:57.608
Actually,

00:06:57.807 --> 00:06:58.608
you're right.

00:06:58.608 --> 00:06:59.088
Wait.

00:06:59.088 --> 00:07:00.767
Have you noticed
that after we came down,

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:02.687
those ghost hands didn't dare follow?

00:07:04.288 --> 00:07:05.048
Exactly.

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:06.648
They attacked fiercely

00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:08.848
like pitcher plants capturing prey,

00:07:09.168 --> 00:07:11.247
but only dare
to drain us slowly in the air.

00:07:12.207 --> 00:07:13.928
This place must have defenses,

00:07:14.608 --> 00:07:15.887
repelling the ghost hands.

00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:28.608
Then let's stay here for now.

00:07:28.608 --> 00:07:29.848
It might be safer.

00:07:30.608 --> 00:07:32.007
Don't look at his face!

00:07:32.408 --> 00:07:33.648
I'm not. I'm not looking.

00:07:34.048 --> 00:07:35.007
What's wrong?

00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:37.897
I never expected King Shang of Lu

00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:39.807
to look like this.

00:07:41.447 --> 00:07:42.567
This is King Shang of Lu?

00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:44.648
You must be kidding.

00:07:44.648 --> 00:07:46.007
Lying on the altar like that,

00:07:46.447 --> 00:07:47.648
this must be him.

00:07:48.207 --> 00:07:49.488
Green-Eyed Fox Corpse.

00:07:49.807 --> 00:07:50.728
What?

00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:52.288
What is Green-Eyed Fox Corpse?

00:07:54.687 --> 00:07:55.848
Legends say

00:07:56.528 --> 00:07:59.088
it's a rare congenital deformity.

00:08:00.327 --> 00:08:02.367
The ancients treated
such deformities as divine,

00:08:02.367 --> 00:08:04.048
believing them to be spirit-connected.

00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:07.488
At birth,

00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:09.648
they appear normal.

00:08:10.088 --> 00:08:11.488
But during puberty,

00:08:11.488 --> 00:08:14.608
their faces get pointy

00:08:14.807 --> 00:08:16.608
and their eyes turn thin.

00:08:16.807 --> 00:08:19.247
Then they begin to fear the sunlight,

00:08:19.687 --> 00:08:22.127
hiding in dark, cold places.

00:08:22.648 --> 00:08:24.488
Their bodies shed skin repeatedly,

00:08:24.767 --> 00:08:26.367
turning blue-black entirely.

00:08:26.848 --> 00:08:29.007
King Shang of Lu has this fox face too.

00:08:30.528 --> 00:08:33.087
Does it mean
that he had this deformity too?

00:08:37.648 --> 00:08:38.648
Could it be

00:08:40.847 --> 00:08:42.687
that he grew twisted
because he was deformed

00:08:43.487 --> 00:08:44.727
from childhood?

00:08:46.807 --> 00:08:47.768
Young man,

00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:50.447
the Green-Eyed Fox Corpse
is extremely sinister.

00:08:50.768 --> 00:08:52.248
They say just one look at its face

00:08:52.248 --> 00:08:53.327
will infect you,

00:08:54.528 --> 00:08:56.807
turning you into their likeness.

00:08:57.888 --> 00:08:58.888
Just now,

00:08:59.368 --> 00:09:01.288
you didn't look at them, did you?

00:09:03.487 --> 00:09:04.888
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:09:04.888 --> 00:09:06.888
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

00:09:06.888 --> 00:09:08.168
I truly didn't mean it.

00:09:08.487 --> 00:09:10.128
I didn't mean it.

00:09:10.128 --> 00:09:11.248
I didn't mean it.

00:09:11.248 --> 00:09:12.288
You won't change.

00:09:12.528 --> 00:09:13.687
I just made that up.

00:09:17.928 --> 00:09:19.567
This young lady's quite pretty.

00:09:20.567 --> 00:09:22.327
Wait, I should call her granny instead.

00:09:22.807 --> 00:09:24.128
Are you out of your mind?

00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:27.048
Speaking of which, what's your name?

00:09:28.087 --> 00:09:29.768
I've already introduced myself.

00:09:31.248 --> 00:09:32.327
I'm Wu Xie.

00:09:33.087 --> 00:09:33.807
Wu,

00:09:33.807 --> 00:09:35.128
look at this granny here.

00:09:35.607 --> 00:09:37.288
She's been lying here for millennia,

00:09:37.847 --> 00:09:39.207
yet her skin remains intact.

00:09:39.807 --> 00:09:42.087
The preservation method
could be commercial gold.

00:09:42.087 --> 00:09:43.128
Stop the nonsense.

00:09:43.807 --> 00:09:45.888
Help me pry her off first.

00:09:47.248 --> 00:09:49.008
Maybe she fancies you.

00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:51.727
Harder.

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:52.768
One, two, three.

00:10:01.727 --> 00:10:02.888
She is so strong.

00:10:03.184 --> 00:10:05.552
I could hear bones cracking,
but she still wouldn't let go.

00:10:05.768 --> 00:10:06.687
I've got an idea.

00:10:07.368 --> 00:10:08.727
Move your head back.

00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:10.048
No way! Don't!

00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:11.327
What're you doing?

00:10:11.567 --> 00:10:12.687
Are you going to chop her?

00:10:13.327 --> 00:10:14.528
What if there's poison?

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:15.847
She's done nothing,

00:10:15.847 --> 00:10:17.168
but you try to chop her arm off.

00:10:17.447 --> 00:10:18.327
Does that seem right?

00:10:20.447 --> 00:10:23.048
You're quite the gallant one, huh?

00:10:23.048 --> 00:10:24.528
Stop the nonsense. Find a solution.

00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:27.567
Fine.

00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:29.528
I will find a way.

00:10:32.607 --> 00:10:33.327
Listen.

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:35.648
If corpses remain undecayed after death,

00:10:36.008 --> 00:10:38.327
there must be
a unique preservation technique.

00:10:39.008 --> 00:10:40.368
When you came down earlier,

00:10:40.528 --> 00:10:42.487
did you notice anything unusual?

00:10:46.727 --> 00:10:47.408
Oh, right.

00:10:47.607 --> 00:10:49.207
There seems to be something
in her mouth.

00:10:58.207 --> 00:10:59.248
Look.

00:10:59.727 --> 00:11:00.768
How tragic.

00:11:00.768 --> 00:11:01.727
Shoving such a big key

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:02.847
into such a small mouth.

00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:04.368
She must be suffering.

00:11:05.048 --> 00:11:05.928
I bet

00:11:05.928 --> 00:11:07.768
she'll let go if you remove the key.

00:11:16.288 --> 00:11:17.567
Are you scared?

00:11:18.288 --> 00:11:19.344
You do it if you are not.

00:11:19.344 --> 00:11:20.176
Fine, I'll do it.

00:11:22.607 --> 00:11:23.928
Wait, you're so close together.

00:11:23.928 --> 00:11:25.447
How do I reach between you?

00:11:25.447 --> 00:11:26.408
Then stop yapping.

00:11:26.408 --> 00:11:27.528
I'll handle it myself.

00:11:27.928 --> 00:11:29.687
Fine. Handle it yourself then.

00:11:49.128 --> 00:11:49.847
Stop!

00:11:50.008 --> 00:11:50.807
Wu Xie,

00:11:51.128 --> 00:11:52.087
this level of mechanism

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:53.207
is beyond your skills.

00:11:53.648 --> 00:11:54.928
One touch could kill you.

00:11:55.327 --> 00:11:56.567
Don't act recklessly.

00:11:58.248 --> 00:11:58.967
Third Uncle.

00:12:00.248 --> 00:12:01.207
You can see me?

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:02.487
Where are you?

00:12:03.327 --> 00:12:04.687
I'm below the steps.

00:12:05.087 --> 00:12:06.447
I'll explain later.

00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:08.727
Now, follow my instructions.

00:12:09.248 --> 00:12:10.847
Tilt the corpse's head down.

00:12:11.288 --> 00:12:12.408
Use your thumb

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:13.768
to press her throat,

00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:14.967
and slap the back of her head.

00:12:15.207 --> 00:12:15.928
Remember.

00:12:15.928 --> 00:12:17.368
You must press her throat firmly.

00:12:17.368 --> 00:12:19.128
Or she'll swallow the key.

00:12:41.368 --> 00:12:42.687
What's this?

00:12:48.008 --> 00:12:48.847
Wu Xie,

00:12:49.408 --> 00:12:51.048
there's a fat guy with you, right?

00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:52.408
Yes.

00:12:52.687 --> 00:12:54.487
Did you find anything odd about him?

00:13:00.727 --> 00:13:01.727
Not really.

00:13:02.768 --> 00:13:03.607
Listen carefully.

00:13:03.847 --> 00:13:05.168
Let me tell you something.

00:13:05.288 --> 00:13:06.168
Don't panic.

00:13:06.168 --> 00:13:07.528
The person before you

00:13:07.528 --> 00:13:09.008
isn't the real Pangzi.

00:13:09.807 --> 00:13:11.528
The real one is with our team.

00:13:11.967 --> 00:13:13.768
Pan Zi and Da Kui are interrogating him.

00:13:14.447 --> 00:13:15.967
So you need to stay alert.

00:13:19.207 --> 00:13:20.727
T-That's impossible.

00:13:20.928 --> 00:13:22.288
I've encountered

00:13:22.487 --> 00:13:24.288
similar experiences when I was young.

00:13:24.592 --> 00:13:26.336
Just now, he was urging you

00:13:26.336 --> 00:13:28.336
to put your hand
into that female corpse's mouth,

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:28.976
right?

00:13:29.528 --> 00:13:30.847
He was trying to harm you.

00:13:31.408 --> 00:13:32.607
What should I do now?

00:13:33.888 --> 00:13:35.008
No matter what he says,

00:13:35.207 --> 00:13:36.408
don't believe any of it.

00:13:37.168 --> 00:13:37.967
Right now,

00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:39.727
look around for anything useful nearby.

00:13:39.727 --> 00:13:40.528
Quick!

00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:57.368
What are you doing?

00:13:58.248 --> 00:13:59.567
How dare you

00:14:00.768 --> 00:14:02.727
lie to me?

00:14:08.207 --> 00:14:09.008
What are you doing?

00:14:22.888 --> 00:14:23.768
Stay back!

00:14:24.248 --> 00:14:25.008
Stay back!

00:14:25.168 --> 00:14:25.928
Stay back!

00:14:26.168 --> 00:14:26.928
Stay back!

00:15:39.408 --> 00:15:40.248
Pangzi.

00:15:44.888 --> 00:15:45.648
Pangzi.

00:15:45.928 --> 00:15:46.607
Pangzi.

00:15:49.528 --> 00:15:50.967
Don't look into his eyes.

00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:09.288
This isn't right.

00:16:32.087 --> 00:16:32.928
Wu.

00:16:33.327 --> 00:16:34.048
What?

00:16:34.567 --> 00:16:36.288
Did I strangle her?

00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:38.888
You nearly strangled me.

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:42.288
What do you mean?

00:16:42.687 --> 00:16:43.648
Just now,

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:45.087
we were hallucinating.

00:16:49.567 --> 00:16:51.567
Was I strangling you this whole time?

00:16:54.687 --> 00:16:55.847
Sorry, bro.

00:16:56.487 --> 00:16:57.967
I genuinely didn't realize...

00:17:03.447 --> 00:17:04.928
Why does my head hurt so bad?

00:17:06.687 --> 00:17:08.128
Why does my head hurt so bad?

00:17:13.088 --> 00:17:14.568
There's even a lump here.

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:20.568
You fell on the ground earlier.

00:17:25.928 --> 00:17:26.608
No.

00:17:27.007 --> 00:17:28.447
I landed on my left side.

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:29.848
Why is there a lump on the right?

00:17:31.007 --> 00:17:32.727
I must've been hit by something.

00:17:33.808 --> 00:17:35.487
When did we start the hallucination?

00:17:35.608 --> 00:17:37.007
And why did we start hallucinating?

00:17:38.328 --> 00:17:39.727
Since we're here,

00:17:39.727 --> 00:17:41.527
it should be
after going down the platform.

00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:42.848
Could it be related

00:17:42.848 --> 00:17:44.608
to looking at the Green-Eyed Fox Corpse?

00:17:44.608 --> 00:17:45.808
I don't know either.

00:17:46.447 --> 00:17:48.207
But there must be
a more logical explanation.

00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:50.192
We couldn't have shared
the same hallucination.

00:17:50.192 --> 00:17:50.967
Well...

00:17:51.328 --> 00:17:53.047
Maybe it's related
to the elixir he took?

00:17:53.888 --> 00:17:55.487
Anyway, just stop looking at him.

00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:04.432
- Just in time,
- Your box...

00:18:04.432 --> 00:18:05.207
come take a look.

00:18:07.368 --> 00:18:08.568
Quick. Hurry up.

00:18:08.767 --> 00:18:09.648
Quick.

00:18:09.648 --> 00:18:11.088
W-What should I look at?

00:18:11.967 --> 00:18:13.328
Do you see this hole here?

00:18:14.168 --> 00:18:15.047
What about it?

00:18:16.168 --> 00:18:17.007
Take this.

00:18:21.408 --> 00:18:22.288
Doesn't this look like

00:18:22.967 --> 00:18:23.928
a key?

00:18:24.287 --> 00:18:26.128
Doesn't it look a bit new?

00:18:27.248 --> 00:18:27.984
Just now,

00:18:27.984 --> 00:18:30.668
in the hallucination, Third Uncle
said to slap the back of her head.

00:18:31.047 --> 00:18:31.888
Should we slap it?

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:35.767
You'd trust words from a hallucination?

00:18:37.247 --> 00:18:38.368
This box

00:18:38.568 --> 00:18:39.888
is probably a fake.

00:18:39.888 --> 00:18:40.727
This craftsmanship

00:18:40.727 --> 00:18:42.487
was developed in Germany
a few years ago.

00:18:43.648 --> 00:18:44.608
Where have you seen it?

00:18:44.967 --> 00:18:46.328
Panjiayuan's full of them.

00:18:49.447 --> 00:18:50.608
Then I'll take it out.

00:18:53.088 --> 00:18:53.727
Fake.

00:18:54.287 --> 00:18:55.287
It should be fake.

00:19:12.368 --> 00:19:13.648
Look. There's a silk thread.

00:19:20.128 --> 00:19:22.247
There's something in her belly?

00:19:28.048 --> 00:19:31.120
(Mechanism explanation)

00:19:32.608 --> 00:19:34.287
Didn't expect it's really a mechanism.

00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:37.487
Be careful.

00:19:37.487 --> 00:19:38.608
There should be

00:19:38.608 --> 00:19:40.128
a hidden crossbow mechanism inside.

00:19:40.808 --> 00:19:41.608
The ancients

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.368
loved placing

00:19:43.848 --> 00:19:45.088
crossbows in corpses.

00:19:45.648 --> 00:19:47.687
They'd connect the mechanism
with golden threads.

00:19:48.328 --> 00:19:49.888
If tomb raiders didn't know it

00:19:50.007 --> 00:19:52.007
and remove everything
from the corpse's mouth,

00:19:52.568 --> 00:19:54.168
they'd inevitably snap the threads,

00:19:55.047 --> 00:19:56.088
triggering the crossbow

00:19:56.088 --> 00:19:57.088
in her belly.

00:19:57.408 --> 00:19:59.047
Bows would pierce through the corpse.

00:19:59.447 --> 00:20:00.247
At that moment,

00:20:00.247 --> 00:20:01.568
with people standing close,

00:20:02.207 --> 00:20:03.207
there's no way to dodge.

00:20:03.888 --> 00:20:05.128
So we must not

00:20:05.928 --> 00:20:07.608
break these golden threads.

00:20:08.128 --> 00:20:09.767
We can only

00:20:10.967 --> 00:20:12.007
snap it softly.

00:20:13.848 --> 00:20:14.487
Done.

00:20:14.928 --> 00:20:15.967
How'd you know that?

00:20:15.967 --> 00:20:16.687
I'm good, right?

00:20:17.368 --> 00:20:18.568
How did her hands let go?

00:20:20.487 --> 00:20:21.608
Is she trying to...?

00:20:30.687 --> 00:20:31.447
Are you okay?

00:20:36.648 --> 00:20:37.287
Wu,

00:20:38.247 --> 00:20:39.608
didn't you say snapping the thread

00:20:39.608 --> 00:20:41.088
wouldn't trigger the mechanism?

00:20:41.767 --> 00:20:43.888
Did you snap it wrong?

00:20:45.487 --> 00:20:47.088
If this is a defense mechanism,

00:20:47.608 --> 00:20:49.447
that means the contents of this box

00:20:49.447 --> 00:20:50.687
are incredibly valuable.

00:20:52.767 --> 00:20:54.007
It'll be at least the Gui Seal.

00:20:55.328 --> 00:20:56.487
But that's not right.

00:20:56.848 --> 00:20:58.247
How would an ancient mechanism

00:20:58.247 --> 00:21:00.047
be connected

00:21:00.047 --> 00:21:01.007
to a German-made key?

00:21:08.888 --> 00:21:10.527
Actually, we could leave now.

00:21:11.808 --> 00:21:14.368
The real Gui Seal must've been taken.

00:21:14.487 --> 00:21:15.967
They left a fake here

00:21:15.967 --> 00:21:17.967
to mislead anyone who came after.

00:21:18.848 --> 00:21:19.608
Where's the key?

00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:20.608
Right here.

00:21:33.287 --> 00:21:34.328
Did you use enough force?

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.568
I almost snapped it in half.

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:42.928
The key shape matches perfectly.

00:21:42.928 --> 00:21:44.287
Why won't it open?

00:21:46.487 --> 00:21:48.007
It must've been made by amateurs.

00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:49.007
It's missing parts.

00:21:56.848 --> 00:21:57.687
What's happening?

00:22:11.007 --> 00:22:11.808
Wu.

00:22:12.608 --> 00:22:13.888
It's just decomposition.

00:22:16.648 --> 00:22:18.128
You scared me to death.

00:22:22.168 --> 00:22:24.368
I never thought the key
had preservation properties.

00:22:25.088 --> 00:22:26.207
That shot earlier

00:22:26.207 --> 00:22:27.287
must've pierced her belly.

00:22:27.608 --> 00:22:29.608
Air got inside
and sped up decomposition.

00:22:30.447 --> 00:22:31.408
Wait, Pangzi.

00:22:31.888 --> 00:22:33.408
Is something missing here?

00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:35.967
There really is...

00:22:36.368 --> 00:22:38.088
Where's the fox corpse?

00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:39.888
When did it disappear?

00:22:41.687 --> 00:22:43.047
Could it be that King Shang of Lu

00:22:43.527 --> 00:22:44.648
is alive?

00:22:46.128 --> 00:22:47.928
Did his immortality elixir work?

00:22:51.128 --> 00:22:52.328
Be careful.

00:22:58.967 --> 00:22:59.848
Pangzi,

00:23:00.088 --> 00:23:01.368
this place is too sinister.

00:23:01.608 --> 00:23:02.287
Hurry. Let's go.

00:23:02.287 --> 00:23:03.328
Hurry up.

00:23:07.168 --> 00:23:08.168
Be careful.

00:23:09.247 --> 00:23:09.808
Go.

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:10.928
Hurry, Pangzi.

00:23:12.888 --> 00:23:13.767
- Go.
- Go.

00:23:27.088 --> 00:23:28.247
Wu Xie!

00:23:29.368 --> 00:23:30.767
Wu Xie, where are you?

00:23:31.247 --> 00:23:32.408
Is that Wu Xie?

00:23:32.727 --> 00:23:33.727
Wu Xie!

00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:37.128
Can you hear me?

00:23:38.328 --> 00:23:39.608
Young Third Master!

00:23:41.207 --> 00:23:42.487
What?

00:23:42.487 --> 00:23:43.727
It's safe here.

00:23:43.727 --> 00:23:44.727
Just call out.

00:23:45.608 --> 00:23:46.527
What?

00:23:47.007 --> 00:23:48.687
Third Uncle, what are you saying?

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:51.007
Wu Xie!

00:23:51.608 --> 00:23:53.408
What?

00:23:59.088 --> 00:24:01.168
Stay there and wait for us, okay?

00:24:02.207 --> 00:24:04.007
Third Uncle, what are you saying?

00:24:04.007 --> 00:24:04.928
Wu Xie!

00:24:05.487 --> 00:24:07.408
Don't leave that passageway!

00:24:07.408 --> 00:24:08.967
There's Tianxin Rock up there.

00:24:08.967 --> 00:24:10.447
The snake cypress can't pass through.

00:24:11.207 --> 00:24:12.408
What?

00:24:14.767 --> 00:24:16.128
Stay over there!

00:24:16.888 --> 00:24:18.808
Speak louder!

00:24:18.808 --> 00:24:20.648
I can't hear you!

00:24:22.888 --> 00:24:23.767
Behind you!

00:24:23.888 --> 00:24:25.287
Watch your back!

00:24:26.408 --> 00:24:27.207
What?

00:24:27.527 --> 00:24:28.767
What are they saying there?

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.047
I can't hear a single word.

00:24:32.568 --> 00:24:33.727
I can't hear them either.

00:24:33.727 --> 00:24:34.527
Behind you!

00:24:34.648 --> 00:24:36.007
Watch your back!

00:24:52.408 --> 00:24:53.368
Young Third Master,

00:24:53.368 --> 00:24:54.487
get out of the way!

00:24:54.888 --> 00:24:55.687
Oh, no.

00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:57.128
It's controlling him.

00:24:57.128 --> 00:24:57.848
Get up.

00:24:58.487 --> 00:24:59.168
Come on.

00:24:59.608 --> 00:25:00.247
Draw the bow.

00:25:05.928 --> 00:25:06.568
What's wrong?

00:25:06.568 --> 00:25:07.767
Why are you frozen?

00:25:11.568 --> 00:25:13.136
Dazzled by my handsome face, right?

00:25:14.727 --> 00:25:16.328
Pangzi, don't move.

00:25:16.608 --> 00:25:17.447
What?

00:25:17.808 --> 00:25:19.368
There's something on your back!

00:25:29.088 --> 00:25:29.967
Loose!

00:25:38.928 --> 00:25:40.007
Got him!

00:25:40.007 --> 00:25:40.928
Take care of Pan Zi.

00:25:40.928 --> 00:25:41.767
I'll go first.

00:26:06.568 --> 00:26:07.328
Wu Xie.

00:26:09.128 --> 00:26:09.928
Wu Xie.

00:26:10.928 --> 00:26:11.727
Wu Xie.

00:26:13.727 --> 00:26:14.447
Third Uncle.

00:26:17.888 --> 00:26:18.888
What's wrong with you?

00:26:19.287 --> 00:26:20.088
Are you okay?

00:26:20.648 --> 00:26:21.368
I'm fine.

00:26:25.368 --> 00:26:26.928
You really reek.

00:26:27.168 --> 00:26:28.207
Good that you're okay.

00:26:30.007 --> 00:26:30.727
Third Uncle,

00:26:30.928 --> 00:26:32.287
it's too sinister.

00:26:32.487 --> 00:26:33.848
Just one glance and I was trapped.

00:26:34.128 --> 00:26:35.128
I couldn't move at all.

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:37.608
Third Uncle,
just now in the hallucination,

00:26:37.608 --> 00:26:39.047
you almost killed me.

00:26:39.687 --> 00:26:40.967
Then how do you know

00:26:41.447 --> 00:26:43.207
that I'm not a hallucination now?

00:26:47.088 --> 00:26:47.767
Impossible.

00:26:48.048 --> 00:26:49.447
You looked so disgusted with me.

00:26:49.447 --> 00:26:50.808
You couldn't be a hallucination.

00:26:51.168 --> 00:26:52.408
Who is not disgusted with you?

00:26:57.568 --> 00:26:58.247
Third Uncle,

00:26:58.608 --> 00:26:59.888
Pan Zi's shot was amazing.

00:27:00.015 --> 00:27:01.415
It pierced right through his bones.

00:27:01.967 --> 00:27:03.007
How did he do it?

00:27:03.207 --> 00:27:04.447
It's not the arrow's power.

00:27:04.608 --> 00:27:07.287
His skull bones had already crumbled.

00:27:07.287 --> 00:27:08.088
Third Uncle,

00:27:08.287 --> 00:27:09.527
don't look at his eyes.

00:27:09.888 --> 00:27:10.447
Yes.

00:27:10.888 --> 00:27:11.568
Don't look.

00:27:19.287 --> 00:27:20.207
No problem.

00:27:20.608 --> 00:27:21.967
His eyes are fake.

00:27:24.568 --> 00:27:25.848
They were made of stone

00:27:26.368 --> 00:27:27.888
and embedded later.

00:27:28.888 --> 00:27:30.527
What trapped you in hallucinations

00:27:30.608 --> 00:27:31.727
was this hexagonal bell.

00:27:31.727 --> 00:27:32.767
It's broken now.

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:36.888
This bell again.

00:27:37.447 --> 00:27:39.447
Thought it was
a daytime corpse resurrection.

00:27:41.928 --> 00:27:43.007
From our perspective,

00:27:43.007 --> 00:27:44.808
Pangzi was carrying him while walking.

00:27:45.287 --> 00:27:46.967
You must've been influenced
by the fox mask

00:27:46.967 --> 00:27:48.727
and the bell's psychological suggestion.

00:27:49.368 --> 00:27:51.687
Did you have close contact
with him earlier

00:27:54.128 --> 00:27:55.848
and then inhaled hallucinogenic powder?

00:28:02.408 --> 00:28:03.047
What?

00:28:03.328 --> 00:28:04.128
Third Uncle,

00:28:04.447 --> 00:28:06.168
we inhaled it multiple times.

00:28:06.287 --> 00:28:08.287
Then why did Pangzi and I

00:28:08.287 --> 00:28:10.128
share the same hallucination?

00:28:11.727 --> 00:28:13.808
Do you know mass hallucinations?

00:28:14.128 --> 00:28:15.447
Because of identical bells?

00:28:15.447 --> 00:28:16.608
Half right.

00:28:17.447 --> 00:28:18.168
You

00:28:18.527 --> 00:28:19.608
have remarkable resilience.

00:28:19.767 --> 00:28:22.207
You survived
after being haunted by this.

00:28:22.408 --> 00:28:23.848
Show your gratitude to the heavens.

00:28:24.527 --> 00:28:25.447
I've got it.

00:28:25.648 --> 00:28:26.848
This is a poison-eagle.

00:28:27.767 --> 00:28:29.487
The mask looks like a fox,

00:28:29.487 --> 00:28:31.247
but it actually represents an eagle.

00:28:32.527 --> 00:28:35.168
Poison-eagle's a monster
from the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

00:28:35.168 --> 00:28:35.808
Legend says

00:28:35.808 --> 00:28:37.727
its cry induces hallucinations.

00:28:37.727 --> 00:28:40.328
Actually, no such creature exists.

00:28:40.328 --> 00:28:41.207
The ancients used

00:28:41.687 --> 00:28:42.527
an eagle-shaped bell

00:28:42.527 --> 00:28:44.624
to mimic its call and worship

00:28:44.624 --> 00:28:45.456
the heavens.

00:28:46.368 --> 00:28:46.967
How's that?

00:28:46.967 --> 00:28:47.687
All matched.

00:28:47.687 --> 00:28:49.287
What matched?

00:28:49.287 --> 00:28:50.287
Impressive.

00:28:51.128 --> 00:28:52.767
You look like a fool.

00:28:53.687 --> 00:28:54.928
Poison-eagle?

00:28:54.928 --> 00:28:56.287
Read some science books.

00:28:57.552 --> 00:28:59.088
Don't laugh. He's talking about you.

00:28:59.408 --> 00:29:00.207
Third Master!

00:29:00.207 --> 00:29:01.767
Enough jokes. Pan Zi's here.

00:29:02.287 --> 00:29:03.287
He saved your life.

00:29:03.287 --> 00:29:04.207
Go kowtow to him.

00:29:08.928 --> 00:29:10.736
- Pan Zi.
- Young Third Master.

00:29:10.736 --> 00:29:12.128
- Are you okay?
- I'll take this.

00:29:12.247 --> 00:29:13.727
Third Master asked you to kowtow.

00:29:13.727 --> 00:29:14.608
Do it now.

00:29:14.928 --> 00:29:15.848
I absolutely will.

00:29:16.207 --> 00:29:17.527
If not for your shoot earlier,

00:29:17.527 --> 00:29:18.648
I'd be dead meat.

00:29:19.128 --> 00:29:20.207
You brat.

00:29:21.527 --> 00:29:22.967
Don't celebrate too soon.

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:24.368
It's not over yet.

00:29:27.928 --> 00:29:28.687
Bro,

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:31.608
thanks for saving us just now.

00:29:34.687 --> 00:29:35.928
How did you get out?

00:29:36.287 --> 00:29:37.608
I'm tough to kill.

00:29:41.007 --> 00:29:41.928
Those vines

00:29:41.928 --> 00:29:43.007
are so terrifying?

00:29:44.568 --> 00:29:46.168
We've got a secret weapon.

00:29:47.808 --> 00:29:48.888
Let me show you.

00:29:49.128 --> 00:29:50.727
- They're terrified of this.
- Come on.

00:29:51.447 --> 00:29:52.447
Stone?

00:29:52.447 --> 00:29:54.207
The vines fear this stone?

00:29:55.328 --> 00:29:57.808
This stone's called Tianxin Rock.

00:29:58.687 --> 00:30:00.287
It's specifically used to suppress

00:30:00.487 --> 00:30:02.888
the creature
called Nine-Headed Snake Cypress.

00:30:03.967 --> 00:30:04.808
Look.

00:30:05.648 --> 00:30:07.088
The snake cypress parasites

00:30:07.088 --> 00:30:08.767
on that giant tree over there.

00:30:09.527 --> 00:30:10.568
There's a tree there?

00:30:11.088 --> 00:30:12.007
Look closer.

00:30:12.168 --> 00:30:13.408
The fog's clearing.

00:30:22.608 --> 00:30:24.447
Good heavens!

00:30:25.047 --> 00:30:26.967
Something's moving in the tree.

00:30:29.007 --> 00:30:30.527
These are Nine-Headed Snake Cypresses?

00:30:32.527 --> 00:30:34.687
There seems to be something
hanging beneath them.

00:30:36.328 --> 00:30:37.007
They're...

00:30:38.207 --> 00:30:39.648
They're corpses.

00:30:41.487 --> 00:30:43.207
All that's hanging up there are corpses!
