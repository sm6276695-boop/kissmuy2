=Episode 8=
(Lord Yi and Ji Yuanying's Doomed Day)

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.680
His Majesty arrives.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.200
Qingci,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.480
I've come to see you.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.760
I'm coming in.

00:01:51.205 --> 00:01:52.280
All right, Your Majesty.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.360
Qingci,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.560
I had the imperial physician

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.920
prepare this herbal censer.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.000
It helps restore your health.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.440
Qingci,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.640
are you running a fever?

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.000
Why are your lips so red?

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.120
I'm too worried about you.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.720
Sorry, I'm being too forward.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.120
Thank you for your concern,
Your Majesty.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.200
I'm fine.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.720
"Thank you for your concern,
Your Majesty?"

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.360
Go now.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.720
What's wrong?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560
Is there something

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.440
on me?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.520
No.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.320
What are you doing?

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.400
Your Majesty,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.960
it's time to take a medicinal bath.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.120
Your Majesty...

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.200
All right.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.560
Take care.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.920
I'll visit another day.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.640
Who cares about this?

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.520
You finally came.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.440
Hurry and get me out.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.440
I want to kill that wretch.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.160
It's useless even if I get you out now.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.040
You can't kill her.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.680
What do you mean?

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.240
Are you not helping me?

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.280
How could I not?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.240
I told you.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.920
Jealousy makes you beautiful.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.480
I brought you something
from the White-Clad Immortal.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.440
It makes people speak the truth.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.600
Her guard isn't ordinary.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.920
I'll deal with him for you.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.240
Our feud

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.640
can't be settled easily.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.120
No matter the cost,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.920
I'll drag you into the abyss.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.600
She took it?

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.720
Yes, Master.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.640
I believe

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.560
that woman has already taken it.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.880
Who would have thought

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.000
her jealousy was so strong?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.440
But one person's jealous spirit

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.720
won't sustain your body.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.840
Your Silver Fox scent is leaking.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.240
You must find a new host
as quickly as possible.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.000
Yes, Master.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.600
(Lord Yi is indeed a corrupt official.)

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.120
Miss Qingci, Lord Yi sends for you.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.000
All right.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.440
Father.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.760
You're here too, Yuanying.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.320
You're out now.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.240
After all,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.680
blood is thicker than water.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.800
Save that fake sympathy.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.400
Father,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.000
she came to me and forced me to reveal
the secret account.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.480
I found it strange

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.240
and feared she might harm
Lord Yi's Residence,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.920
so I asked this of the White-clad Immortal.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.120
(White-clad Immortal?)

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.480
(Is there a hidden hand behind this?)

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.360
What are you talking about?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.360
What White-clad Immortal?

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.240
What secret account?

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.920
I've never heard of any of this.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.760
I knew you always had a way with words.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.360
Seeing you now,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.120
you're good at distorting the facts.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.840
But

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.880
this will make you speak the truth.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.480
It's called Truth Serum.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.920
Whoever drinks it,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.240
no matter how eloquent they can be,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.560
can only speak the truth.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.440
Father, aren't you afraid
Yuanying might poison me?

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.760
I had it tested.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.840
It's safe.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.920
But it makes one

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.280
speak without hiding.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.880
Speak without hiding?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.240
Really?

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.360
If you won't drink it,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.480
you must be hiding something.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.240
Even if you refuse to drink it,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.000
I will force it down your throat.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.600
Speak up.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.600
Are you Ji Qingci?

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.360
Speak up.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.840
Of course not.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.800
Is all of this your plot against me?

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.680
Yes.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.160
Why are you impersonating Ji Qingci?

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.240
My only purpose is

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.680
to avenge myself

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.600
and Qingci.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.920
Father, she admits it.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.960
The Silver Fox's scent may be faint,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.440
but it should be in this room.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.520
It's him.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320
Very well.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.560
You came here yourself.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.160
Du Ya from the Silver Fox Clan.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.080
It's you.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.600
So what if you guessed it?

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.960
Everyone who knows must die.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.400
You won't leave here alive today.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.280
Qingci?

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.800
To avenge Qingci?

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.280
Where is

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.400
the real Qingci?

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.680
I saw with my own eyes

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.880
that Ji Qingci

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.480
was killed by her own sister.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.400
And you killed your sister.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.200
Father, that's not what she said it was.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.440
Qingci slipped and drowned herself.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.800
You must believe me.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.320
I never said Ji Qingci drowned.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.280
No.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.000
Father.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.440
The Truth Serum really works.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.760
It makes everyone speak the truth.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.720
Good.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.760
I wanted to tell the truth anyway.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.960
If I'd known you had such a good thing,

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.280
I wouldn't have wasted all this trouble.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.320
You're still insolent
even at death's door.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.320
You're out of tricks.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.960
You still don't understand.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.800
I was proven

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.880
to be the legitimate daughter of Lord Yi

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.160
before His Majesty

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.000
and everyone else,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.560
while you were deemed a madwoman
who falsely accused her sister

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.560
out of jealousy,

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.680
before the Emperor and everyone.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:43.920
Father.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.760
But Father, I'm your true daughter.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.680
Scoundrel!

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.880
And you too!

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.560
All of you have been lying to me!

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.720
This is bad.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.120
Guards!

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.600
Drag

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.560
these two vile women away.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.440
We'll just announce publicly

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.440
that Ji Yuanying

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.160
was driven mad by jealousy

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.480
to kill her sister, and then took her life
in fear of punishment.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.440
Make sure there are no loose ends.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.680
Father.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.160
I knew it.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.160
I knew it.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.800
Nothing matters

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.720
but your reputation

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.840
and status.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.720
Daughters mean nothing

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.680
to you at all.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.720
How dare you!

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.760
Guards.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.560
Stand back.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.920
Yuanying,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.960
why must it come to this?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.320
I know I was wrong.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.320
Put the sword down.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.040
We can still be a family.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.280
Father,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.920
do you know you were wrong,

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.600
or that you're afraid?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.640
No! Don't!

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.040
It's her.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.680
Yes.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.040
It's her.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.560
She did it.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.280
Kill her.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.160
Kill her, and everything will be fine.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.920
What are you waiting for?

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.320
Kill her now.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.680
