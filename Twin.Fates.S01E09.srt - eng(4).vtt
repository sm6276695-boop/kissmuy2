(Snow Falls Light, Yet It Can Bury All)

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.360
Kill her!

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.320
Now do you feel fear?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.080
Useless! You useless lot!

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.640
Get her! Kill her!

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.320
Today,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.560
only one of you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.040
will live.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.000
You

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
never

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.560
loved me…

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.920
You corrupted justice
and ruined so many lives.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.240
Did you ever expect

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.840
the day would come
when kin would turn on kin?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.200
Speak.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.200
Why did you frame the Mu family

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.280
and cause the death
of the entire Mu family?

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.080
I understand now.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.040
You are

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.760
the daughter

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.080
who escaped from the Mu Residence!

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.640
Answer me.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.520
Who ordered my father's murder

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.960
and set the Mu family up?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.160
I've never met this man.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.760
All I know

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.600
is he is no common man.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.960
He moves with extreme caution.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.720
I never

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.040
even saw

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.320
his true face.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.640
I only remember

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200
hearing later

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.720
that he sought to find someone
inside the Mu Residence.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.440
He mentioned

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.360
the Xuanzhu Jade.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.080
The Xuanzhu Jade?

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.200
My father's name was unblemished,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.760
yet it was ruined
by a despicable being like you!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:09.960
(Complainant: Yi Mei)

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.440
I thought it was over,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.480
but it was only the beginning.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.520
Worse still,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.720
I don't even know who the mastermind is.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.760
He mentioned the Xuanzhu Jade.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.600
The Xuanzhu Jade?

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.040
It turns out

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.760
they coveted the Xuanzhu Jade I wear.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.400
I brought ruin on the Mu family.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.360
They died because of me.

They died because of me…

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.160
It's not your fault.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.380
The fault lies
with the hand that plotted everything.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.400
You must not punish yourself

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080
for a villain's crime.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.520
You're right.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.520
Those who should be punished are they.

I'm fine.

No matter who the mastermind is,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.280
human or deity,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.200
I will root them out one by one.

If the mastermind

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.760
seeks the Xuanzhu Jade,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.040
then he must be tied
to the Silver Fox Clan.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.080
Whatever their objective,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.600
I will destroy
every one of their schemes.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.160
I will make them see

that their plots to control the world,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.080
their hollow wealth, their framing of the loyal,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.280
are nothing but an illusion.
