00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.880
(In ancient times,)

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.760
(a meteorite split into nine fragments
that fell to Earth.)

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.039
(Where meteorites fell,)

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.359
(all lifeforms
were contaminated by radiation,)

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.800
(transforming
into entirely new lifeforms.)

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.079
(In isolated environments,)

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.159
(they formed self-contained ecosystems.)

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.320
(Humanity)

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.320
(couldn't survive
within these ecological chains.)

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.920
(Ancient people considered this
divine revelation.)

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.600
(They constructed temples
to worship the meteorites.)

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:49.520
(But the meteorites' power)

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.399
(was too extraordinary.)

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.240
(Those who obtained them)

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.880
(sought to keep their existence secret.)

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.079
(Thus, they devised methods)

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.560
(to conceal the temples.)

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.799
(Yet these ecosystems)

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.359
(still exist worldwide,)

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.760
(awaiting new waves
of greedy opportunists)

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.560
(and unsuspecting trespassers.)

00:01:22.228 --> 00:01:26.656
(Dart Summit, Hezhou, 1920s)

00:01:36.627 --> 00:01:37.467
Well.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:39.280
Now we're

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.599
in deep trouble.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.560
(Old Smoker)
The soil's bloody.

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.000
(Young Wu Laogou)
There's a blood corpse down there.

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:50.359
If we mess this up,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.040
everything we've got

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.319
will get buried below.

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.079
Yes or no? Just one word.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.120
(Er Yazi)
Stop this nonsense.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.560
(Beardy)
Respect your great-grandpa!

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.680
When he was tomb raiding,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.799
you were still a fetus.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.000
I wasn't wrong.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.560
Our ancestors said

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.239
blood corpses bring good fortune.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.319
Want to lose your head?

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:13.919
Your second great-uncle

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.439
dug up one of these
by South River earlier.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.319
He's still crazy to this day.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.039
No idea what cursed him.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.199
Down or not? Decide now.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.000
No more excuses.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.599
When

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.919
the hole's ready,

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.199
I'll go first.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.639
Er Yazi, bring up the rear
with the drag hoe.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.439
San Yazi,

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.520
stay up here.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.360
If we all go down,
there's no time to retreat.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.120
Hold the drag hoe's tail up here.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.680
When we shout from below,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.759
pull it out immediately.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.000
I don't want to stay.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.840
I'm going down too.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.159
I'll dig right now.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.639
You brat! Are you testing my patience?

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.759
Got a death wish?

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:11.719
Enough!

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.280
Boys, gear up.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.360
Let's work.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.319
I'll find you a golden blade down there.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.319
Be good.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.319
It's dangerous.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.400
Er Yazi,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.360
are you done?

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.400
Quiet.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.600
Stay there and hold the rope tight.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.360
Move quicker.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.079
Try harder.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:31.199
Quieter!

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.279
There is movement.

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.000
San Yazi!

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:51.719
Pull!

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.480
Poison!

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.519
It's poison!

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.560
San Yazi,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.879
run!

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.240
Er Yazi?

00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:51.723
(Ancient silk manuscript)

00:08:26.228 --> 00:08:31.051
(Wu Laogou's Notes)

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:34.840
(My name is Wu Xie.)

(The San Yazi from the story)

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:38.159
(was my grandfather.)

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:40.799
(He was a tomb raider in Hezhou.)

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.840
(He got his education after 1949)

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:44.559
(and recognized his past mistakes.)

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.919
(Wu Xie)
(To start anew,)

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:50.120
(he gave away his wealth,)

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.279
(married into Hangzhou,)

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.759
(and opened an antique shop.)

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.320
(My grandfather never told me)

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:03.519
(how he survived back then.)

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:05.840
(But that blood corpse he mentioned)

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:08.080
(was his poisoned second brother.)

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.679
(And the bizarre experiences)

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.840
(in his notes made me)

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.000
(believe)

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:17.440
(that there must be sides of him
I've never seen.)

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.240
Xie,

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:22.559
remember this.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.919
The clever ones always claim
with confidence,

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:27.720
"See beyond mountains

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.120
and see beyond waters."

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.480
But

00:09:30.879 --> 00:09:32.480
the truly remarkable people

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:35.360
see mountains as mountains

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.759
and water as water.

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:41.639
Fifth Master.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.600
Alright.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:51.759
Be careful.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.120
How many times have I told you?

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.120
The things you did in the past

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:06.200
will become responsibilities

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:07.919
you'll carry in the days to come.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.560
Just go.

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.120
I'll handle this matter.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.440
Okay.

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:27.440
Xie.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.840
(My grandfather spent his entire life)

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.120
(trying to resolve
the karmic consequences.)

00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:40.600
(The accounts in this notebook
seem thrilling,)

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.759
(but they were shackles
to my grandfather)

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.440
(that bound him until his dying day.)

(Wushanju)

(As you can see,)

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:36.600
(to this day,)

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.679

(Since childhood,)

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.800
(I've rarely)

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:43.720
(ventured beyond my doorstep.)

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:46.639
(When will my legendary life)

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.960
(finally begin?)

00:13:16.692 --> 00:13:20.800
(Jin Wantang, 'Gold Tooth')

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:25.639
Do you accept rubbings here?

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.280
We do.

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:29.559
Prices aren't high.

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:35.279
Let me ask you something.

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:38.519
Do you have rubbings
of an ancient silk manuscript?

00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:40.759
I mean the one from decades ago

00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:42.559
that some tomb raiders
from Hezhou retrieved

00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:45.080
but later got swindled out of.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.039
You just said it was swindled out of.

00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:51.559
How would I have it?

00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:54.080
Besides, you should hunt for rubbings
at the market.

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:56.799
No one looks for a specific scroll.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.240
I heard you have connections.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.879
Lao Yang sent me.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.120
I know the rules.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.360
This is the token.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.080
Fine, let's say Lao Yang sent you.

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:27.719
What do you want?

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.559
I'm not here

00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:30.960
to see you.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.840
I came to meet your grandfather.

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:37.159
Didn't he once dig for treasures?

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:40.120
What's your game?

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.879
No games.

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:44.399
I just want to ask

00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:46.879
if your grandfather has kept

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:48.440
one or two rubbings

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.000
of the silk manuscript

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.279
retrieved from Dart Summit in Hezhou.

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:53.239
Wang Meng,

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:54.399
see him out.

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:56.919
What's this about?

00:14:56.919 --> 00:14:57.799
We had a good chat.

00:14:57.799 --> 00:14:59.200
Why are you throwing me out?

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.040
Please leave now.

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:03.320
At least check out what I brought.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.080
I've brought it.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.440
Just take one glance, won't you?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.280
Wang Meng.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.200
Just do it for Lao Yang's sake.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.920
Fine.

00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:16.480
For Lao Yang's sake.

00:15:16.755 --> 00:15:18.080
(Ancient silk manuscript's rubbing)

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:21.399
Take a look.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.600
It's a photocopy?

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:27.240
You're no amateur.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.440
Who carries real treasures

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.759
around the streets?

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.240
They'd crumble to dust.

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:36.360
Besides, every trade has its own ways.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.600
Your grandfather was too young

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.360
when he started tomb raiding,

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.840
which broke the rules.

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:52.480
This thing

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.960
is well-preserved,

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.000
but

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:56.479
it's a fake.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.879
A fake?

00:15:58.519 --> 00:15:59.759
That can't be.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.559
Anyway, I can't verify it.

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:04.200
Go find another expert.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.040
Wait.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.960
Does this match
what your grandfather saw

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.000
back then?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.919
Let me be honest.

00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:13.519
My grandfather was illiterate back then.

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:15.000
He couldn't read this.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.240
I can't tell you.

00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:17.639
What a coincidence.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.360
Yes, indeed.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.320
Seems like there's really no hope left.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.279
Right.

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:32.399
Got it.

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:36.639
Collecting ancient texts
is complicated business.

00:16:36.799 --> 00:16:38.559
You shouldn't get too greedy.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.320
Young man,

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:41.559
see you around.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.879
See you around.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.600
I'm leaving.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.440
See you.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:11.920
Wang Meng,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.760
the camera.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:21.960
You left something.

00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:24.160
Thank you.

00:17:24.759 --> 00:17:26.680
We'll meet again.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.640
(Wushanju)
(Little did I know then)

00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:36.519
(that his appearance
would change my entire life.)

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.079
(This silk manuscript)

00:17:57.079 --> 00:17:58.839
(resembles the one
my grandfather had then.)

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.799
(I'm almost certain)

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.240
(they're part of the same set.)

00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:04.440
(My gut tells me)

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.000
(Third Uncle)
(this silk manuscript holds secrets.)

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.920
(I plan to ask Third Uncle.)

00:18:10.919 --> 00:18:11.759
(In our family,)

00:18:11.759 --> 00:18:13.599
(only he inherited Grandpa's skills.)

00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:15.559
(In many ways,)

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:17.480
(he's even better than Grandpa was.)

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:20.160
(People outside call him Third Master.)

00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:22.440
(Due to business reasons,)

00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:25.640
(Third Uncle usually responds
to phone calls promptly.)

00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:27.720
(But there's always a day or two,)

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:29.279
(like today,)

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.960
(when he becomes totally unreachable,)

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.559
(as if he's vanished.)

00:19:06.899 --> 00:19:08.113
(Wu Sanxing)

00:19:23.759 --> 00:19:24.720
(Third Uncle)
Nine o'clock.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.880
(Good stuff. Come quick.)
Chicken-eye yellow sand.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.080
Dragon's Spine.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.280
Come quick.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.839
(Many years later,)

00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:39.240
(I would recall)

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:41.400
(that from the moment I brought)

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.119
(the manuscript to Third Uncle,)

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.279
(my life)

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:47.480
(would undergo earth-shaking changes.)

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.960
Third Uncle,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.440
why didn't you wait for me?

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.480
Your junk food's all ready.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.320
Hurry up.

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:53.519
Can you eat now?

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:54.880
You left me dinner,

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.119
not Dragon's Spine?

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.839
Fine.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.720
It's not the first time anyway.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.960
You trick me every time.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.319
To you,

00:21:05.319 --> 00:21:07.359
that thing is similar to Dragon's Spine.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.839
There'll be new good stuff tomorrow.

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:10.559
Eat first.

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:11.359
Really?

00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:14.279
Tomorrow's stuff
will be three times better.

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:17.759
Just eat your junk.

00:21:17.759 --> 00:21:18.799
Such a feast.

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:19.759
I wonder

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.440
why anyone would eat the junk.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.799
Third Uncle,

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:29.240
why wouldn't you hold
that good stuff longer for me?

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.559
What stuff?

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.000
Dragon's Spine.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.920
I took one look at its shape

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:38.160
and knew roughly what was inside.

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.759
An ancient weapon.

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:43.599
Right?

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.960
But strangely enough,

00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:51.000
the person who bought Dragon's Spine

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.279
didn't look very old.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.359
What's his background?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.920
So wealthy.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.319
Must be some rich kid.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:59.039
Don't you know the rules?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.079
Don't ask about missed treasures.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.920
If you missed it, you missed it.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.839
Take the loss.

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:04.679
Understand?

00:22:05.519 --> 00:22:07.279
I don't even want that thing.

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:08.920
What I encountered today

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.680
was way more impressive than yours.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.160
It's literally
the most bizarre thing I've seen

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.440
since entering this trade.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.279
More bizarre than what you're eating?

00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:18.039
About the same.

00:22:18.239 --> 00:22:19.079
Try some.

00:22:19.079 --> 00:22:19.599
Get lost.

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:20.640
Stop bothering me.

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:22.160
Come on, take one.

00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:23.440
It's delicious.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.960
Get me a tissue.

00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:36.519
This is dog food.

00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:37.640
Don't waste it.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.880
Shut up.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.720
What exactly are you here for?

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.720
Out with it.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.519
Actually,

00:22:44.759 --> 00:22:46.039
this afternoon,

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:47.960
a strange old man came to my shop.

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:49.440
He had a gold tooth.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.559
He wanted me
to check out this silk manuscript.

00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:54.000
Truth is,

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.880
he wanted to see Grandpa's manuscript.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.599
I compared them.

00:22:57.599 --> 00:22:59.440
It resembles the one in Grandpa's notes.

00:23:01.843 --> 00:23:03.808
(Ancient silk manuscript's rubbing)

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:07.519
Look, Third Uncle.

00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:09.480
Your expression changed.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.880
Are you feeling
a little stirred up inside?

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:15.759
Third Uncle.

00:23:16.119 --> 00:23:17.119
Third Uncle.

00:23:18.359 --> 00:23:20.359
Release your inner passion.

00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:21.959
Get lost.

00:23:23.759 --> 00:23:25.240
Doesn't this look like a fox to you?

00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:26.599
An ancient silk manuscript

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.440
is worthless

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.920
unless it's a unique copy.

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:30.959
Understand?

00:23:30.959 --> 00:23:31.759
Take it.

00:23:31.759 --> 00:23:32.599
Wait.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.960
I only understand parts of it.

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:36.599
It mentions

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:39.839
a feudal lord from Lu State

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.759
and records some events from his life.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.160
Keep going.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.000
Come on.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.880
It says

00:23:48.519 --> 00:23:50.079
he possessed a Gui Seal.

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:53.359
(This Gui Seal)

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.119
(could command a special army.)

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.839
(That army's soldiers
only moved at night)

00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:03.680
(and had unusual physiques.)

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:05.720
(They left)

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.640
(no footprints wherever they walked.)

00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:13.240
(Third Uncle, this is made up, right?)

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.640
(Even fiction has real-world origins.)

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.160
Something still feels off.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.920
This silk manuscript is strange.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.759
Not the legend itself.

00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:28.599
No footprints? Easy to explain.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.400
A broom tied behind one's waist
could do that.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.240
What's strange is,

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:36.160
at first glance
of this fox-face pattern,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.440
it looks like a stain.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.960
But if it were a stain,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.680
how could it look so vivid
and three-dimensional?

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.720
Maybe someone intentionally painted it?

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.880
But why would they

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.480
disguise it as a stain?

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.359
To hide something?

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.640
Not bad.

00:24:53.319 --> 00:24:54.720
You're observant.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.400
But your knowledge is lacking.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.160
I've repeatedly invited you here

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.920
to learn from me, but you refuse.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.640
Now you can't decipher it.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.440
This is a map.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.480
A map?

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.320
Yes.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.759
The ancients called it

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.559
the Eight-Array Diagram

00:25:14.039 --> 00:25:16.200
or Pictorial Text.

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:17.920
It encodes a location's

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.400
exact geographical details

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.119
through special syntax,

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:23.000
disguised as a legend

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.440
but packed with information.

00:25:26.319 --> 00:25:29.400
Frankly, besides me,

00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:31.759
fewer than five people worldwide
can read this.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.880
So you're saying,

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:36.640
find a specific spot,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.119
turn left,

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:40.720
then right until a tree,

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.480
go straight, then right,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.319
find a well,

00:25:43.319 --> 00:25:45.000
and jump in?

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.359
Exactly.

00:25:46.759 --> 00:25:47.839
That's what it means.

00:25:47.839 --> 00:25:49.359
Just jump in when finding a well.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.319
That well's reserved for you.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.880
What now?

00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:56.279
I don't know how.

00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:57.400
No one's born knowing this.

00:25:58.759 --> 00:25:59.599
Fine.

00:25:59.599 --> 00:26:01.160
I'll explain it to you now.

00:26:03.315 --> 00:26:04.768
(Study of Stars)

00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:07.880
(Each of these symbols)

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.880
(represents a different star.)

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.559
(But more importantly,)

00:26:12.039 --> 00:26:13.559
(they can form)

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.839
(hundreds of combinations.)

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.400
(Let's take this set of symbols
as an example.)

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.000
(By connecting these stars)

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:24.960
(we can create a topographic map.)

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.240
(By combining layers
of topographic maps,)

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.960
(the area indicated by the final map
progressively shrinks)

00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:33.279
(and becomes more specific.)

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.440
It's actually very simple.

00:26:35.759 --> 00:26:36.599
Got it?

00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:38.759
Such a complex map.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.559
Where exactly does it point?

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.799
And this manuscript is clearly a fake.

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:44.400
Though it's a fake,

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.119
its contents might still be genuine.

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:47.400
I'll look into it.

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:48.680
Third Uncle,

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:50.039
I understand now.

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:53.119
You're saying someone deliberately

00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:54.400
created this map

00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:55.960
and recorded the story of Lu State?

00:26:56.759 --> 00:26:57.640
Third Uncle,

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.119
you're so interested.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.119
Do you want
to visit the map's marked spot?

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.160
Third Uncle,

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.000
this is exactly like

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.119
the opening scene
of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

00:27:06.599 --> 00:27:07.439
Third Uncle,

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:09.400
let me go with you, okay?

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.599
I want to join you

00:27:11.599 --> 00:27:13.160
in embarking on this journey.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.640
You can come.

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:16.960
I see no problem.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.680
Let's call your dad first, alright?

00:27:20.759 --> 00:27:23.079
If he agrees, anything goes.

00:27:25.839 --> 00:27:26.839
Never mind. Forget it.

00:27:26.839 --> 00:27:27.640
Third Uncle,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.000
no need to involve my dad.

00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:30.359
Think carefully, Third Uncle.

00:27:30.359 --> 00:27:31.440
I'm old enough now

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.920
to go out and see the world.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.400
Take me with you.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.079
I'll obey you...

00:27:35.079 --> 00:27:35.919
Listen to me.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.119
Call your dad first.

00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:38.799
If he approves, I'll take you.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.680
Let's see if he'll break your legs.

00:27:41.759 --> 00:27:43.000
How will you walk without legs?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.720
Come on.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.759
Want me to call him?

00:27:45.079 --> 00:27:46.839
If I say Wu Xie wants to go with me,

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.200
he'll come to break your legs.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.040
If you won't take me,

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:50.279
then stop reading it.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.359
Where are you?

00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:11.119
There's a lead on that earlier matter.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.400
I need your help.

00:28:16.359 --> 00:28:18.160
(Third Uncle will definitely
call me back.)

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.960
(The map's still with me.)

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:22.240
(He can't possibly not call me back.)

00:28:37.428 --> 00:28:42.624
(Web Article:
How to Capture a Man's Heart.)

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.039
(He's really not calling me back?)

00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:47.480
(Could he have memorized the whole map?)

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.040
Third Uncle.

00:29:00.919 --> 00:29:01.759
Third Uncle.

00:29:01.759 --> 00:29:02.519
Third Uncle,

00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:03.880
long time no see.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.080
Well,

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:05.640
Third Uncle,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.960
I've always felt in this family,

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.640
you're the one who understands me best.

00:29:09.519 --> 00:29:10.359
When you were young,

00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:11.759
you defied the family's objections

00:29:11.839 --> 00:29:13.039
to pursue what you wanted too.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.079
The world belongs
to the brave and visionary

00:29:15.079 --> 00:29:16.680
who pursue and explore.

00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:18.159
I know

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.079
your care and love for me are boundless.

00:29:21.079 --> 00:29:22.319
You taught me

00:29:22.359 --> 00:29:24.519
about the vastness of this world.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.319
Third Uncle,

00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:28.319
please take me with you.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.240
Third Uncle.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.480
Where'd you get this act?

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.559
How long did you rehearse?

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.720
Jane Eyre.

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:35.880
Then go home. Won't walk you out.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.960
Wait, Third Uncle,

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.839
I'm begging you.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.960
Let's get to the point.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.720
Okay?

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.079
Anyway, the map's in my hands.

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:41.880
You can't memorize

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.559
hundreds of symbols
even with your memory.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.519
You're resourceful,

00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:45.640
and I can't outsmart you.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.240
But if you won't take me,

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.359
I'll tear it up.

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:50.079
We'll go our separate ways then.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.480
Threatening me now?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.039
Where'd you get this?

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.039
Think it over carefully.

00:29:59.039 --> 00:29:59.839
Wait.

00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:01.240
Third Uncle. Third Uncle.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.280
Third Uncle.

00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:06.399
What's wrong?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.920
You've already contacted Gold Tooth?

00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:12.039
In the antique circle,

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:14.880
you can't survive
without some shrewdness.

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:16.359
Someone like you

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.519
will squander our family fortune
sooner or later.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.880
About Gold Tooth,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.079
his real name is Jin Wantang.

00:30:30.839 --> 00:30:33.160
He's not the original owner
of this item.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.599
The owner of this silk manuscript
is surnamed Ma.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.160
He's a famous antique dealer.

00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:40.799
(Five years ago,)

00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:42.519
(he suddenly disappeared
without a trace.)

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:45.160
(Everything started
with this manuscript.)

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:47.160
(While acquiring artifacts,)

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.000
(he unexpectedly found this manuscript)

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.400
(in a northwest peasant household.)

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.559
(He must have realized)

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:55.359
(this manuscript was actually a map.)

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.160
(So he began studying it day and night.)

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:01.319
(Ma studied it for ten full years)

00:31:01.319 --> 00:31:02.960
(before finally deciphering the map.)

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.599
(Then he spent a fortune)

00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:07.960
(hiring top-tier outdoor experts.)

00:31:08.839 --> 00:31:10.200
(But shortly after departure,)

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.160
(the entire team lost contact.)

00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:18.960
(His wife only knew he went)

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.960
(to the location marked on the map.)

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.200
(Though not knowing the exact spot,)

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.680
(she knew
it must be extremely dangerous.)

00:31:29.599 --> 00:31:32.200
(She kept spending money
searching for her husband)

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.759
(for five whole years)

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.279
(without finding any clues.)

00:31:36.759 --> 00:31:37.920
(Gold Tooth)

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.079
(was also hired by Ma's wife.)

00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:41.759
(He has some real skills.)

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.279
He discovered this manuscript originally

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.319
was in your grandfather's possession.

00:31:46.319 --> 00:31:47.359
Believing your grandfather

00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:48.720
could definitely decipher the map,

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.759
he approached you.

00:31:52.039 --> 00:31:53.039
Third Uncle,

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.359
I was only gone for a moment,

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:57.400
and you've gathered
all this information?

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.799
Don't tell me

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.119
you've already taken Ma's job?

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.839
Do you know

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:10.720
how much he offered?

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.240
How much?

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.119
This much?

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:17.599
Third Uncle,

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.279
if you go,

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:21.480
you can't go alone, right?

00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:24.640
Then why tell me all this?

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.359
Are you taking me too?

00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:29.599
Why?

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.039
Give me one good reason to take you.

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:36.000
I

00:32:36.599 --> 00:32:37.960
could probably

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.200
help carry some equipment.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.680
Alright.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.240
Our basic equipment

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.920
starts at

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.279
fifty kilograms minimum.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.559
Two people means a hundred kilos.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.480
But

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:50.559
I need two more team members.

00:32:51.079 --> 00:32:53.960
Four people
means two hundred kilos total.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.240
Who will you carry for?

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.319
Will you carry mine?

00:32:57.759 --> 00:32:59.319
Your own gear too, right?

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:01.119
Can you handle a hundred kilos?

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.359
Enough.

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:04.839
Just say you don't want me to go.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.880
Fine, I'm leaving.

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.480
My shop opens tomorrow.

00:33:09.839 --> 00:33:10.679
Bye.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.559
Leaving so soon?

00:33:30.599 --> 00:33:31.839
As a Wu,

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.519
you gave up so easily?

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.799
Seems like

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:38.599
you didn't really want to go anyway.

00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:41.519
What do you mean?

00:33:43.119 --> 00:33:44.200
You'll take me?

00:33:47.839 --> 00:33:49.200
Your dad agreed.

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:53.599
This is a search mission.

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:55.920
He says it's relatively safe.

00:33:56.519 --> 00:33:57.960
I don't want our family's only heir

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.200
to miss out on adventuring.

00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:01.480
But this is the last time.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.000
Your coming with me

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.119
is better than your sneaking off alone.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.360
Two things before departure.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:11.999
First,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.440
crack the code.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.559
Second,

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.199
recruit two more members.

00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:39.159
Got headshotted again.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:40.192
He sees through walls?

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.240
He's cheating?

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:42.960
Who is it? Who's cheating?

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.239
That guy over there.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.159
Bro, that brat's definitely cheating.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.079
He's won ten rounds,
making us look idiotic!

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.800
That brat.

00:35:01.679 --> 00:35:02.519
Buddy,

00:35:03.719 --> 00:35:04.639
having fun?

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.320
You're a cheater, right?

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.639
Say something!

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.000
You think you're the boss here?

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.079
When someone talks to you,

00:35:21.079 --> 00:35:22.760
you should respond properly.

00:35:23.559 --> 00:35:25.559
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

00:35:27.719 --> 00:35:28.559
Stop looking at me!

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:49.559
Your phone.

00:35:50.579 --> 00:35:52.352
(Wu Sanxing: Got a job. Come quick.)

00:35:55.731 --> 00:35:58.239
(Xingao Internet Cafe)

00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.079
How are you?

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:00.519
Are you guys okay?

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.760
Ma'am,

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.760
don't cry.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.440
Hello, doctor.

00:36:06.559 --> 00:36:07.880
Thank you for your hard work.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.760
Wait.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.760
I wanted a 20 yuan discount
on the nursing fee.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.960
Is crying really necessary?

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.280
When doing business,

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.719
there's always some haggling.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.679
No 20-yuan discount anymore.

00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:25.400
Okay?

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.239
Okay?

00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:27.079
Stop crying.

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:29.800
How about ten?

00:36:42.227 --> 00:36:47.744
(Third Master: Got a job. Come quick.)

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.320
Stop crying.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.119
Stop it!

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.960
I'll raise it by 20.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.880
50?

00:36:58.519 --> 00:36:59.760
Take good care of my mom.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.039
You have my word.

00:37:17.719 --> 00:37:19.360
(The helpers Third Uncle
found this time)

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.280
(are familiar to me.)

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.679
(This is Pan Zi,)

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.320
(Third Uncle's
longest-serving subordinate.)

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.239
(When Third Uncle audits accounts,)

00:37:28.599 --> 00:37:29.800
(he always brings Pan Zi.)

00:37:30.199 --> 00:37:31.159
(With him present,)

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.920
(no debt goes uncollected.)

00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:36.239
(In my memory,
anything Third Uncle demanded,)

00:37:36.519 --> 00:37:37.880
(he could always deliver.)

00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:40.159
(Though fierce to others)

00:37:40.599 --> 00:37:41.840
(and feared by everyone,)

00:37:42.239 --> 00:37:43.079
(he's kind to me.)

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:43.960
Young Third Master.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.679
(He's taken me everywhere
since childhood.)

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.719
(This is Da Kui.)

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.079
(His strength is legendary.)

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.000
(He can kill an ox with one punch.)

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.000
(He operates without principles.)

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.280
(Except toward Third Uncle,)

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.360
(for others, payment alone)

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.000
(can make him work against allies.)

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.320
(He's even double-dealing.)

00:38:09.159 --> 00:38:11.719
(I never trusted his integrity.)

00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:12.719
(Until he retorted,)

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:15.639
("Can integrity save my mother's life?")

00:38:15.759 --> 00:38:16.599
(That's when I knew)

00:38:16.599 --> 00:38:18.079
(his mother was critically ill)

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.159
(and he needed a lot of money.)

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.120
Hello.

00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:22.519
Third Master.

00:38:22.519 --> 00:38:23.480
Sharper than ever.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.760
- Third Master.
- Bulked up.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.679
I got a new liquor.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.640
We'll try it later.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.800
This time we're retrieving one person.

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:30.440
The client's paying eight million.

00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:31.760
We'll split it.

00:38:34.159 --> 00:38:35.440
But here's the thing.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.079
About where we're going,

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.800
I don't know yet.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.840
First, we need to decipher this map.

00:38:44.499 --> 00:38:48.156
(Ancient silk manuscript's rubbing)

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.880
(Kulou 10.)

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.079
(Zhu 8.)

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.800
(Beihe 1?)

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.639
Any progress?

00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:08.479
Got it.

00:39:09.079 --> 00:39:11.880
(These symbols form
an ancient Lu State terrain map.)

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.239
(Refine further.)

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.159
(Jiuqi 2.)

00:39:17.519 --> 00:39:18.639
(Tianlao...)

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.920
(Sangong 1.)

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:22.400
(And five fuxi stars.)

00:39:30.239 --> 00:39:31.239
Let me see.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.800
It matches.

00:39:36.159 --> 00:39:38.760
(It's Quling County
within ancient Lu territory.)

00:39:44.199 --> 00:39:45.039
Young Third Master,

00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:46.239
let me look again.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.600
This?

00:39:48.679 --> 00:39:49.519
Right.

00:39:50.359 --> 00:39:51.199
Look.

00:39:51.199 --> 00:39:53.519
(The place called Hechuan in Quling.)

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:55.440
It looks like the star map.

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:05.079
Right.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.039
There's hope.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.519
Come on.

00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:15.840
(Hechuan corresponds
to present-day Pengzhou.)

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.920
(We're almost there.)

00:40:18.119 --> 00:40:20.119
(This shows mountain ranges.)

00:40:20.719 --> 00:40:22.079
(This depicts rivers.)

00:40:23.199 --> 00:40:24.559
(Stack them all together.)

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.760
A bit over here.

00:40:34.519 --> 00:40:35.400
(They match.)

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.840
(The map's center points
to an underground cave.)

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.480
Let's go to Pengzhou first.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.680
(We leave tomorrow.)

00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:55.079
(We drank heavily that night.)

00:40:55.559 --> 00:40:57.239
(I was in a daze.)

00:40:57.239 --> 00:40:59.280
(Everything felt surreal.)

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.119
(I thought I'd seized this opportunity.)

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.159
(Am I right, Grandpa?)

00:41:20.199 --> 00:41:21.440
