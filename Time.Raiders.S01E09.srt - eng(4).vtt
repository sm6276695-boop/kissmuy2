00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.499
(Pan Zi was gravely injured.)

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:05.900
(The village clinic couldn't save him.)

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.940
(We barely paused for breath)

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.500
(and immediately took him
to the county hospital.)

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.416
(Pengzhou City West Hospital)

00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:46.384
Hello?

00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:48.400
Hello?

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.139
Is this Da Kui's mother?

00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:52.859
I'm his employer, Wu Sanxing.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.060
Mr. Wu,

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.980
I've heard so much about you from Kui.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.019
How is

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.179
Kui performing at work?

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.820
If he makes any mistakes,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.459
please discipline him strictly.

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.419
Not at all.

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.100
He's been doing excellent work.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.859
So I wanted to tell you.

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:17.100
Since he's performing so well,

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.540
the company decided to send him overseas

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.179
for several more years.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.459
The pay is better there,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.500
which means he won't be returning

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.380
anytime soon.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.940
That's all.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.139
That's fine.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.139
He should focus on his career.

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.419
Don't worry about me.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.660
Good to hear.

00:03:43.888 --> 00:03:45.008
Thank you.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.699
Well,

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.540
Da Kui

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.380
couldn't bring himself to tell you,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.260
so he asked me

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:55.340
to call you.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.579
Rest assured.

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.500
He wanted me to remind you

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.660
to take your medicine on time

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:05.619
and take care of yourself.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.179
Okay.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.139
Tell him not to worry.

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:14.699
Every month

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:15.859
the company will

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.619
transfer money
to your account regularly.

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:19.980
So you can

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.939
rest assured.

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:23.100
Mr. Wu,

00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:25.379
Kui...

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:28.179
Is he...

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:31.020
Is he doing alright?

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:35.100
He's... He's fine.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.700
Don't worry.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.980
Thank you.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.499
I need to go.

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:53.460
(Call to check)

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.379
(if Ma's payment has been transferred.)

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:57.580
I'll distribute it this way.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.660
Pan Zi's share

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.179
stays with him.

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:05.059
I've decided to decline

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.780
my share.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.939
I've also decided

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:08.619
for your share.

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:10.220
You won't take it either.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.340
Okay.

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:13.819
(As for Pan Zi's medical expenses,)

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.499
(put them on the company's account.)

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.859
(Transfer it over.)

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:19.140
(Understood?)

00:06:19.856 --> 00:06:20.498
(Okay.)

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:22.020
(Got it.)

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:25.619
(Wu Xie,)

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.379
(think carefully.)

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.900
(Is this really the life you want?)

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:36.660
(I sent Ma's letter)

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:39.939
(I was wrong)
(to his wife as Third Uncle suggested.)

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:55.939
(As for Xiaoge,)

00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:58.660
(Third Uncle keeps warning me)

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.580
(not to ask about
that otherworldly master.)

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.419
(But I'm too curious about him.)

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:05.980
(Who exactly is he?)

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.660
(How did he obtain
such formidable abilities?)

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:10.100
(The creatures)

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.660
(we couldn't possibly defeat)

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:14.660
(all feared him.)

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.140
(He's shrouded in mysteries.)

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:27.140
(And I keep feeling)

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.580
(we only survived)

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.900
(because of him.)

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.140
(But what about him?)

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:35.619
(Is he truly safe?)

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.859
(He stayed behind to save us.)

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.100
(Could he really escape that place?)

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.900
(Is he even still alive?)

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:07.580
(To be honest, Third Master,)

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.340
my approach is simple.

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:11.379
I just like working under you.

00:08:17.648 --> 00:08:18.544
- Leopard! Leopard!
- Leopard! Leopard!

00:08:18.544 --> 00:08:19.499
- Chicken!
- Tiger!

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.059
I called chicken!

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:22.140
(My mom)

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:23.580
wants me to change my job

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.739
and find something safer.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.220
Or take vocational exams.

00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:27.340
I'll finish mine.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.220
Do as you please.

00:08:52.772 --> 00:08:55.060
(Wine)

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.139
Are you sure?

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.859
Alright.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:02.940
I see.

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:07.060
You mailed the report to my place?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:07.980
Got it.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.019
Thanks for your help.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.220
What's up, Third Uncle?

00:09:37.988 --> 00:09:39.472
(Wine)

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.859
The manuscript is fake.

00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:50.180
Fake?

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:51.619
How's that possible?

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.619
The appraisal institute

00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:57.420
just said

00:09:58.739 --> 00:10:02.220
the gold purity
in the manuscript is too high.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.539
Ancient techniques
couldn't achieve such quality.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.220
So they declared it fake.

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:14.619
That Purple Jade Box

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:15.859
must be fake too.

00:10:15.859 --> 00:10:17.499
Someone swapped it beforehand.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.980
Third Uncle, did you find something?

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:23.659
My oversight.

00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:24.940
I should've realized earlier.

00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:28.300
The crux lies in

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.060
Xiaoge.

00:10:35.499 --> 00:10:36.700
He could've easily

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:38.739
killed that blood corpse,

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:40.180
so why did he keep running

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.139
and running?

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.539
He only killed it at the last moment.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.940
He was trying to ditch us

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.659
to act alone.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.220
Xiaoge isn't ordinary.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.700
During our separation,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.019
did he plant the fake Purple Jade Box

00:10:58.019 --> 00:10:58.899
in King Shang of Lu's

00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:00.739
ritual vessel?

00:11:00.739 --> 00:11:01.739
But how?

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.779
The tree hollow was torn open by chains.

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:06.659
Any tampering

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:07.980
would've left visible marks.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.259
Did you check beneath the vessel?

00:11:11.539 --> 00:11:12.820
Maybe he dug

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.420
behind the tree

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.019
straight to the vessel's base

00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:19.019
and then swapped them.

00:11:29.739 --> 00:11:30.859
So the manuscript's stories

00:11:30.859 --> 00:11:32.060
about King Shang of Lu

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.259
are completely fabricated?

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:36.340
With your limited skills,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.060
you actually deciphered that manuscript?

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:40.580
The forger must've put

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.460
tremendous effort into it.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.060
Seems only he knows

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.300
the secret of that kiln.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:48.019
Wait, I...

00:11:48.859 --> 00:11:49.980
I still don't get it.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.180
Why did he save us at all

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.420
if he wanted the manuscript?

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.580
He could've waited

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.619
for us to die and taken it himself.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.340
Why did he go to such great lengths

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.659
to deceive us?

00:12:01.619 --> 00:12:04.139
Saving and deceiving
aren't mutually exclusive.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:09.060
Sometimes those who help you

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.499
can still lie to you.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.659
Stop overthinking it.

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:23.139
I'm taking a shower.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.580
Drop it.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.060
The only suspect among us

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.379
is him.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.580
Wu Xie, check

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.580
if there's soap in the pack.

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:43.580
These cheap inns lack everything.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:47.499
Third Uncle!

00:12:47.499 --> 00:12:48.460
Well? Found any?

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.104
Hand it over.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.779
Third Uncle, hurry!

00:12:51.499 --> 00:12:52.499
What now?

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.340
Look at this.

00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:57.899
What is it?

00:12:58.899 --> 00:12:59.820
This.

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:04.859
Where did this come from?

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.060
(Back then in King of Lu's kiln,)

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.664
(Green-Eyed Fox Corpse was holding it.)

00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:14.259
Pangzi must've stuffed it in my bag.

00:13:14.499 --> 00:13:15.859
He called it fake.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.100
What is this, Third Uncle?

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.460
It's been treated with copper nitrate.

00:13:22.379 --> 00:13:23.539
This puzzle box

00:13:23.539 --> 00:13:24.899
is used by foreigners

00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:26.300
to store valuables.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.539
Don't be fooled by its size.

00:13:28.659 --> 00:13:30.980
The interior compartment is tiny.

00:13:31.259 --> 00:13:33.739
The locking mechanism requires

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.580
a lot of space

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.779
for its components.

00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:39.659
Understand?

00:13:39.659 --> 00:13:40.420
Wait.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.220
But I have the key.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.019
We took it
out of that female corpse's mouth.

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:44.739
It fits perfectly into this keyhole.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.659
Now try opening it.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.019
Can't twist it open, right?

00:13:57.619 --> 00:13:59.499
This key is meant for locking.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.499
Look.

00:14:00.499 --> 00:14:01.539
If the combination works,

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:02.619
the latch goes click.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.259
But you can't reset it
with the combination.

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:07.499
We need the key to reset it.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:08.940
It's locked.

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:13.139
The craftsman
who made this was brilliant.

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:15.300
These techniques are lost to time now.

00:14:19.739 --> 00:14:20.659
It's open.

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:22.019
Not yet.

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:22.940
Look.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:23.779
Right.

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:26.460
Actually, this is the mechanism

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.580
for the combination lock.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.180
There are

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:30.859
eight rotating dials.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.940
Each is marked from zero to nine.

00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:37.340
If you choose the right combination,

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.619
it'll unlock.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.980
Let me try.

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:44.180
Do you realize what this means?

00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:46.940
Eight dials with ten digits each

00:14:47.499 --> 00:14:48.619
means there are

00:14:49.019 --> 00:14:50.340
100 million possibilities.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.779
That's 100 million
possible combinations.

00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:55.180
Go ahead and try.

00:14:55.739 --> 00:14:58.379
You might still be here
next year trying.

00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:00.659
Later,

00:15:00.659 --> 00:15:02.139
I'll ask my friend who makes replicas

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:02.899
to look at it.

00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:05.539
He might recognize

00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:06.619
this box's maker.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.499
Keep tinkering.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.779
I hope you solve it

00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:16.220
before my friend arrives.

00:15:21.619 --> 00:15:22.779
Eight digits?

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.739
Bro,

00:15:26.739 --> 00:15:28.060
let me cover for you.

00:15:29.739 --> 00:15:32.619
022, 00059?

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.980
It's open.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.220
Impossible.

00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:55.980
How did you open it?

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.340
With the code.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.420
How did you get the code?

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.100
It's "022, 00059."

00:16:02.139 --> 00:16:02.580
Wait,

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.940
how did you know the code?

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.300
From a foreigner's corpse

00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:07.580
at King of Lu's kiln.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.300
His belt had this number.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.180
Hold on.

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:12.340
You said at King of Lu's kiln,

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.619
the foreign corpse's belt

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.379
had this exact code?

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.539
Is this box

00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:21.980
connected to those foreigners?

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.619
There's a fish here.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.580
It's quite intricate.

00:16:49.539 --> 00:16:50.460
Third Uncle,

00:16:50.499 --> 00:16:51.499
you have a fish too.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.180
Do you remember

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.739
Ms. Wenjin?

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.499
She was the leader

00:16:57.499 --> 00:16:59.539
of a geological survey team.

00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.259
She disappeared

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:02.619
during a maritime expedition.

00:17:03.499 --> 00:17:04.140
After that,

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.620
you became a wreck.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:07.660
You couldn't move on for years.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.019
Is her disappearance

00:17:10.019 --> 00:17:11.339
related to this fish?

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.180
(Coming!)

00:17:15.088 --> 00:17:16.420
(Chen Wenjin)
Sanxing, what are you doing?

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:17.460
Hurry!

00:17:18.259 --> 00:17:19.180

(Ru Sea Subsea Geological Survey Team,)

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.259
(move out!)

00:17:34.579 --> 00:17:35.579
(20 years ago,)

00:17:35.779 --> 00:17:37.339
(as the team leader, Wenjin)

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.700
(and some young people)

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.980
(formed a geological survey team)

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.259
(to collect deep-sea samples at Ru Sea.)

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.980
(As the security consultant,)

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.700
(I joined the expedition.)

00:18:06.499 --> 00:18:07.019
Look.

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:07.900
In this direction.

00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:17.872
(Survey Log)

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.380
How's it?

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.700
(We made great discoveries)

00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:26.499
(and collected
diverse geological samples.)

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:27.860
(Even better,)

00:18:28.019 --> 00:18:29.180
(Xie found)

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.660
(giant tube-dwelling worms
in the seabed.)

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.620
(It led us to infer)

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.420
(the sea area not far from there)

00:18:35.579 --> 00:18:37.739
(was very likely to contain
massive oil reserves.)

00:18:38.539 --> 00:18:39.460
(Being the first)

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.940
(to discover the oil in Ru Sea)

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.299
(would undoubtedly become)

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:44.660
(a nation-shaking achievement.)

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:46.860
Great.

00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:49.579
Let's go.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.140
- Great.
- Great!

00:18:51.779 --> 00:18:54.059
(Everyone was eager to go)

00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:55.099
(and so excited.)

00:18:58.299 --> 00:18:59.779
(However,)

00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:02.099
- (as we sailed toward that area,)
- Careful!

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.180
(we encountered a violent storm.)

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.140
Cover it!

00:19:08.259 --> 00:19:09.420
The waves are too strong!

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:12.980
Is it fixed yet?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.059
No luck.

00:19:14.339 --> 00:19:15.579
The leakage is too severe.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:16.420
Find a way.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.579
Find a way to fix it.

00:19:18.099 --> 00:19:18.739
Okay.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.819
(That night,)

00:19:25.819 --> 00:19:28.140
(we nearly all perished at sea.)

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.660
(Fortunately,
the storm cleared the next day.)

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.739
(We reached the island)

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.739
(with tube worms that Xie described.)

00:19:35.739 --> 00:19:37.220
We've arrived!

00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:38.779
We've arrived!

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.304
- We've arrived!
- Really!

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.259
Fantastic!

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.739
We're really here.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.539
We made it!

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.860
We've arrived!

00:20:01.499 --> 00:20:03.980
(After arduous efforts, we'd made it)

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.739
(only to find nothing.)

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:08.460
(Not even traces of the tube worms.)

00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:11.180
(However, underwater)

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.099
(we discovered
ancient porcelain artifacts.)

00:20:15.259 --> 00:20:17.019
(But they were all shattered)

00:20:17.019 --> 00:20:18.420
(and became worthless.)

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.779
(In the following fortnight,)

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:26.380
(we achieved nothing.)

00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:28.940
(Our morale completely collapsed.)

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.700
(Geological Survey Team)
(Some suspected)

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.900
(Xie exploited his expertise)

00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:36.180
- (to lead us to that lone island)
- He's why we're trapped here.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.420
- (for a scam,)
- Exactly.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.440
- (and he had ulterior motives.)
- You came willingly!

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.220
- We came here for the oil.
- You chose to come yourself.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.460
Enough arguing!

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:54.539
(Wenjin and I)

00:20:54.539 --> 00:20:56.819
(sensed disaster brewing)

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.620
(and planned to discuss returning)

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.339
(the next morning.)

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:03.579
(But unexpectedly,)

00:21:05.019 --> 00:21:06.180
(Xie met with tragedy.)

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:09.059
No!

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:10.140
We've got trouble!

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.779
Xie is dead!

00:21:11.779 --> 00:21:13.339
Hurry!

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.700
Just ahead!

00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:19.940
Right here.

00:21:27.739 --> 00:21:28.620
The flashlight.

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:38.980
Sanxing!

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:40.180
I'm fine.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.579
Xie?

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.259
Xie?

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.420
Xie!

00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:27.499
What happened?

00:22:28.099 --> 00:22:28.940
Xie?

00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:30.739
Xie Lianhuan?

00:22:32.339 --> 00:22:34.140
- Xie!
- Xie!

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:49.660
Xie!

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.739
(When Xie died,)

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:09.700
(he clutched this fish in his hand.)

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.140
Everyone wanted to know

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:18.660
what happened to Xie in that cave

00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:21.180
and how exactly he died.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.860
(Xie Lianhuan's death)

00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:28.620
(plunged us into bottomless grief.)

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.779
(We selected one person)

00:23:34.339 --> 00:23:35.779
(to accompany the hired crewmen)

00:23:35.779 --> 00:23:37.660
(in transporting Xie's body
via the main ship.)

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.539
(The rest of us)

00:23:40.539 --> 00:23:42.620
(would complete our work on the island)

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.536
(before returning.)

00:23:46.579 --> 00:23:47.700
(Why did Xie)

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.099
(lure us to the island?)

00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:52.539
(What had he discovered there?)

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.860
(What was with that fish in his hand?)

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.579
(These questions haunted me,)

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.900
(but I could never)

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.460
- (verify them with him.)
- What?

00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:06.620
I'm still a bit concerned.

00:24:08.739 --> 00:24:10.380
With the main ship gone,

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.220
our maritime safety

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.539
has no protection.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.299
Don't worry.

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:16.900
Calm seas are forecast for this week.

00:24:17.299 --> 00:24:18.460
It's all clear skies ahead.

00:24:19.819 --> 00:24:21.099
Everything will be fine.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.779
A week passed.

00:24:37.779 --> 00:24:39.259
The ship never returned.

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:41.860
But we encountered

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.620
an unforeseen crisis.

00:24:46.499 --> 00:24:47.019
Huo Ling,

00:24:47.259 --> 00:24:47.940
hurry!

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.460
Pack the instruments into the cases.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.779
Hurry up!

00:24:50.779 --> 00:24:51.620
Move this away.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.059
Qi You,

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.059
secure the gear.

00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:55.019
The storm's coming!

00:24:55.019 --> 00:24:56.336
- It's coming!
- Wait.

00:24:56.336 --> 00:24:57.456
Explain yourself!

00:24:57.456 --> 00:24:58.259
What's

00:24:58.259 --> 00:24:59.024
the worst case?

00:24:59.024 --> 00:25:00.560
The storm will trigger enormous waves.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.424
Then we'll either

00:25:01.424 --> 00:25:02.900
be smashed against the reefs

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.299
or dragged into the deep sea.

00:25:04.299 --> 00:25:04.940
Also,

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.499
the water will rise five to six meters.

00:25:06.499 --> 00:25:07.819
The island will be submerged.

00:25:07.819 --> 00:25:08.940
Can we hide underwater

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:09.660
with breathers?

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.420
It's useless.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.579
The deepest part here
is barely seven meters.

00:25:12.579 --> 00:25:13.819
If a giant wave hits,

00:25:13.819 --> 00:25:15.620
none of us will survive.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.739
Then what should we do?

00:25:16.739 --> 00:25:17.660
What's the plan?

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.700
Say something!

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.700
Say something!

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.099
What should we do?

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.779
Get to the cave!

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.819
What cave?

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.099
The one where we found Xie.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.620
Everyone, bring your oxygen tanks.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.860
If we dodge the storm,

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.779
we'll survive.

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:31.620
Let's go!

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.259
Got it.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.900
Everyone!

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.900
Get to the cave now!

00:25:36.579 --> 00:25:37.140
Okay!

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.299
Hurry!

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.660
Faster!

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.059
Hurry, run!

00:25:46.059 --> 00:25:47.059
Get into the cave!

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.819
Go!

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.339
Quick, into the water!

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.220
(We had only intended)

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.660
(to take shelter underwater.)

00:26:30.579 --> 00:26:32.620
(Unexpectedly, the pool in that cave)

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:33.779
(led to the seafloor.)

00:26:34.819 --> 00:26:36.460
(Wenjin decided to dive deeper.)

00:26:37.019 --> 00:26:38.259
(There beneath the waves)

00:26:38.259 --> 00:26:40.499
(we discovered a massive shipwreck.)

00:26:50.579 --> 00:26:54.700
(Don't move.
Stay here and wait out the storm.)

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.819
(Let's move forward and investigate.)

00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:12.700
(I tried to stop Wenjin,)

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:14.819
(but that time,)

00:27:14.819 --> 00:27:16.779
(she didn't heed my advice.)

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.180
(At Wenjin's insistence,)

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.059
(we decided to enter.)

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.700
There's oxygen!

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.180
We're saved!

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:09.980
Come on.

00:28:10.059 --> 00:28:11.019
Guys!

00:28:11.019 --> 00:28:11.660
Gather round.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.940
Let's thank Chen Wenjin.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.579
Applaud!

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:20.539
Enough.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.900
Judging by its furnishings
and structure, this shipwreck

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.259
must be over 600 years old.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.420
Why is it so well-preserved?

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.380
And how is there still oxygen?

00:28:32.019 --> 00:28:33.019
This ship

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.539
was likely

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.099
intentionally sunk here.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.339
The passage we came through

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.140
spirals upward.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.339
It was definitely designed deliberately.

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:47.499
The builders

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.180
used this unique structure

00:28:50.579 --> 00:28:53.019
to create air pressure
against seawater intrusion

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.779
while also

00:28:54.779 --> 00:28:57.499
trapping air within the hull.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.579
Who could achieve this so ingeniously?

00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:03.460
Exactly.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:04.779
It's truly brilliant.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.900
Regardless,

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.380
this ship saved our lives.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.499
Once the storm passes,

00:29:09.499 --> 00:29:10.259
we'll be safe.

00:29:10.259 --> 00:29:10.739
Right?

00:29:10.739 --> 00:29:11.739
- Right.
- Right.

00:29:11.739 --> 00:29:12.220
Yes.

00:29:19.339 --> 00:29:21.620
(I noticed the ship was very strange.)

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.819
(Its interior was remarkably intact.)

00:29:24.539 --> 00:29:26.339
(Moreover, the murals there)

00:29:26.339 --> 00:29:28.779
(were covered with legends
about the Forbidden Woman.)

00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:32.140
(The Forbidden Woman
is a goddess from coastal folklore.)

00:29:32.499 --> 00:29:34.220
(Legend says long ago)

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.620
(a pregnant woman fell into the water)

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.299
(and was rescued by fishermen.)

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.499
(Grateful for their help,)

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.620
(she left a scented sachet as thanks)

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.940
(before quietly disappearing.)

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:47.059
(The sachet's fragrance
lingered endlessly,)

00:29:47.299 --> 00:29:49.299
(lasting over a decade without fading.)

00:29:49.779 --> 00:29:51.180
(Since then,)

00:29:51.339 --> 00:29:53.140
(that fishing village enjoyed peace)

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.339
(with favorable weather,)

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.900
(and fishing boats
never encountered storms again.)

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.259
(Until one day,)

00:29:59.499 --> 00:30:01.539
(someone curiously opened the sachet,)

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.299
(revealing)

00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:05.420
(several jade-like bones inside.)

00:30:06.259 --> 00:30:09.339
(These were said to be
the Forbidden Woman's bones.)

00:30:09.339 --> 00:30:10.499
(Naturally fragrant,)

00:30:10.499 --> 00:30:11.980
(they could ward off evil spirits)

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.140
(and protect people.)

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.579
Huo Ling.

00:30:18.099 --> 00:30:19.019
Don't move.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.059
We didn't bring any equipment today.

00:30:31.819 --> 00:30:33.019
And we don't know

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:34.860
what's going on with this shipwreck.

00:30:35.739 --> 00:30:36.900
So I want everyone

00:30:37.299 --> 00:30:38.339
to stay put.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:38.860
Well,

00:30:39.099 --> 00:30:40.900
we can't just stay here forever.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.819
This place is scary.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:42.819
Exactly.

00:30:42.819 --> 00:30:43.499
We're here.

00:30:43.499 --> 00:30:44.059
Let's explore.

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:45.872
- Sanxing is our security consultant.
- Yes.

00:30:46.779 --> 00:30:47.900
Everyone follows his orders.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.460
Do you smell

00:30:51.739 --> 00:30:52.620
a strange fragrance?

00:30:54.739 --> 00:30:56.620
There does seem to be a fragrance.

00:30:59.099 --> 00:30:59.860
Sidi!

00:31:01.779 --> 00:31:03.259
Is this fragrance

00:31:04.539 --> 00:31:06.660
the smell of a Forbidden Woman?

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.499
What are you doing?

00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:14.180
You scared me to death!

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.339
Just kidding.

00:31:16.339 --> 00:31:18.339
(The fragrance
was likely left by ancient people)

00:31:18.339 --> 00:31:20.220
(using spices to match the legends.)

00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:22.140
(Some ancient cultures)

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.019
(painted deities to ward off evil.)

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.099
(I suddenly felt exhausted)

00:31:27.099 --> 00:31:28.499
(and sat down to nap.)

00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:30.579
(Wenjin sat beside me.)

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.460
(My nose was filled with faint perfume,)

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.299
(unsure if it was
Wenjin's natural scent)

00:31:37.299 --> 00:31:40.019
(or the shipwreck's unique scent.)

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.499
(And then almost instantly,)

00:31:42.499 --> 00:31:43.499
(I just)

00:31:43.499 --> 00:31:44.700
fell asleep.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.259
I don't know how long I slept.

00:31:58.259 --> 00:31:59.579
(When I woke up,)

00:31:59.579 --> 00:32:00.900
(I found myself)

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.700
(completely alone there.)

00:32:05.059 --> 00:32:05.980
Wenjin?

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:11.180
(I thought they'd wandered off)

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.779
(while I slept.)

00:32:12.779 --> 00:32:14.059
(I was angry.)

00:32:14.539 --> 00:32:17.059
(I'd specifically warned Wenjin
against wandering.)

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.472
(Notebook)

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:47.180
(But then I realized)

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.180
(it wasn't)

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.460
(the cabin where I'd fallen asleep.)

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.499
(It was an entirely foreign space.)

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.900
(Even the door had vanished.)

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.299
(I was trapped in a sealed chamber.)

00:33:05.779 --> 00:33:07.460
(Worse yet,)

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.779
(when I turned around,)

00:33:08.779 --> 00:33:10.059
(something else)

00:33:10.059 --> 00:33:12.259
(appeared in the chamber.)

00:33:13.499 --> 00:33:15.460
(And something inside it)

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.980
(seemed about to emerge.)

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.380
(At that moment,)

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.140
(I had no tools in my hand.)

00:33:20.819 --> 00:33:21.420
(If whatever)

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.259
(was inside turned out
to be a sea demon,)

00:33:23.259 --> 00:33:24.860
(I'd be defenseless.)

00:33:25.739 --> 00:33:27.059
(I steeled myself)

00:33:27.059 --> 00:33:29.140
(not to let fear cloud my judgment.)

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.660
(So I resolved to escape first)

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.940
(and then rescue the others.)

00:33:49.499 --> 00:33:51.380
(After swimming endlessly,)

00:33:51.739 --> 00:33:53.579
(I finally surfaced.)

00:33:54.259 --> 00:33:55.420
(Shockingly,)

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.940
(it was nighttime the next day.)

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.380
(By then,)

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.380
(the storm had long passed.)

00:34:03.059 --> 00:34:05.180
(I've never understood)

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.539
(why a whole day passed by)

00:34:07.539 --> 00:34:09.179
(as I just dozed off in the shipwreck.)

00:34:15.619 --> 00:34:16.860
After the rescue,

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.539
I remained in a coma
at the hospital for a full week.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.579
When I tried to return and find them,

00:34:23.579 --> 00:34:25.579
the island was nowhere to be found.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:27.380
Everyone,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.619
along with that island,

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.780
had vanished completely.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.219
To this day I still can't comprehend

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.699
what exactly happened during my sleep

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:39.579
in that place.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.340
Later I went to

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.900
both the Maritime Affairs Office
and the Administration Bureau,

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:47.539
but they kept telling me

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.699
that the young people,

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:53.019
including Wenjin, had disappeared.

00:34:53.579 --> 00:34:54.579
They went missing.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.980
After nearly 20 years,

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.019
I still don't understand

00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:05.420
why so many people

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.300
vanished without a trace.

00:35:10.019 --> 00:35:11.900
The group photo from that mission

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.340
has always stayed with me.

00:35:14.619 --> 00:35:15.699
Actually, Third Uncle,

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.499
what I want to ask is

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.139
about that ship cabin's disappearance...

00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:21.139
Have you considered

00:35:22.219 --> 00:35:23.260
why

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.420
they couldn't escape,

00:35:25.099 --> 00:35:26.420
but I could?

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.860
The only difference between me and them

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.659
was this bronze fish I was carrying.

00:35:31.539 --> 00:35:32.340
I guess

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.460
Xie brought it from the shipwreck.

00:35:35.659 --> 00:35:36.860
This fish?

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.579
Is it special?

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.860
I looked

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.179
into this fish.

00:35:42.179 --> 00:35:44.219
Ancient texts call it

00:35:44.219 --> 00:35:46.900
the Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fish.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.300
It's six hundred years old.

00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:50.539
You mean

00:35:50.539 --> 00:35:52.940
King of Lu's kiln
is connected to that shipwreck?

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:54.900
These two sites

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.780
are separated by over a millennium.

00:35:57.059 --> 00:35:59.059
Moreover, why would someone

00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:00.579
use a modern counterfeit box

00:36:00.579 --> 00:36:01.460
to contain this fish

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.980
and place it in an ancient site?

00:36:04.059 --> 00:36:05.740
Don't you find this strange,
Third Uncle?

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.099
This whole affair might be more complex

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:09.699
than we imagined.

00:36:10.059 --> 00:36:12.699
Ma's motives were likely complicated.

00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:16.300
First, file a report
with the Cultural Relics Bureau

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.260
and send them photos of the fish.

00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:21.139
Inquire about its archaeological value.

00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:24.179
Keep it safe until they respond.

00:36:32.099 --> 00:36:33.019
Third Uncle,

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.380
this person looks like Xiaoge.

00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:44.420
But 20 years ago
he should've been just a child.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.940
Why hasn't he aged a day

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.219
in two decades?

00:37:03.219 --> 00:37:04.900
Could this be his father instead?

00:37:14.659 --> 00:37:15.659
(The elevator.)

00:37:18.219 --> 00:37:19.300
The elevator.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.820
The elevator had issues?

00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:25.059
The elevator?

00:37:25.059 --> 00:37:26.980
I understand
what happened back then now.

00:37:27.219 --> 00:37:28.139
Yes.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.499
I must return to Ru Sea immediately.

00:37:32.619 --> 00:37:33.499
Don't follow me.

00:37:33.499 --> 00:37:34.579
Stay and care for Pan Zi.

00:37:34.579 --> 00:37:35.139
Wait.

00:37:35.139 --> 00:37:36.059
Third Uncle!

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.216
Hello?

00:37:50.699 --> 00:37:51.940
They failed.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:53.019
No.

00:37:53.019 --> 00:37:54.619
He has already found it.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.980
What's next?

00:37:58.099 --> 00:37:59.380
Just wait.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.820
He will come to be with us.
