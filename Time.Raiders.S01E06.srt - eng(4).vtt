00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:46.407
Don't move, you two!

00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:50.986
I'll squash you!

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:52.026
Squash you!

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:53.225
I'll squash all of you!

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:54.026
Squash you!

00:01:58.207 --> 00:01:59.088
Get up!

00:02:03.024 --> 00:02:04.112
Fall back to the entrance!

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:09.048
No way! There's too many!

00:02:09.048 --> 00:02:09.967
Fall back!

00:02:12.687 --> 00:02:13.967
Any more instant-fire straws?

00:02:14.288 --> 00:02:15.288
They're in my bag.

00:02:15.288 --> 00:02:16.087
Get them quick!

00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:17.527
I'll get them.

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:18.568
Which bag?

00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:19.687
On the top!

00:02:20.647 --> 00:02:21.687
Found them yet?

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.647
What are all these?

00:02:24.807 --> 00:02:25.927
Got it!

00:02:25.927 --> 00:02:27.128
Here!

00:02:31.487 --> 00:02:32.927
Hurry! Fall back to the entrance!

00:02:34.807 --> 00:02:35.608
No good! No good!

00:02:35.608 --> 00:02:36.608
Go back! Go back!

00:02:36.608 --> 00:02:37.527
Too many!

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:38.832
They're all coming this way!

00:02:39.207 --> 00:02:40.128
I'm sorry.

00:02:40.288 --> 00:02:41.487
Sorry, guys.

00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:42.848
I got you into trouble this time.

00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:45.087
But I truly didn't expect

00:02:45.087 --> 00:02:46.207
such a way to die.

00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:48.168
Think of something!

00:02:48.487 --> 00:02:49.247
Move aside!

00:03:04.408 --> 00:03:05.008
Go! Quickly!

00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:05.608
Move! Hurry!

00:03:05.608 --> 00:03:06.408
Fall back now!

00:03:17.687 --> 00:03:18.328
Hurry!

00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:19.328
Get over here!

00:03:20.048 --> 00:03:21.527
Quick! Give me your hand!

00:03:25.487 --> 00:03:26.967
My butt! My butt!

00:03:27.168 --> 00:03:28.247
Don't bite my butt!

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:29.967
Stop shaking!

00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:31.687
Hold on!

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:43.472
Come on!

00:03:44.752 --> 00:03:45.328
Come on!

00:03:58.168 --> 00:03:58.848
Bro!

00:03:59.247 --> 00:04:00.367
Get up quick, bro!

00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:02.995
Pan Zi!

00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:06.527
Bro!

00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:07.848
Pan Zi! Pan Zi!

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:10.008
Pan Zi! I'm coming for you!

00:04:10.448 --> 00:04:11.487
Don't stop me!

00:04:11.487 --> 00:04:12.328
Let go!

00:04:12.608 --> 00:04:13.807
Don't come down!

00:04:14.848 --> 00:04:16.848
- Pan Zi!
- Leave now!

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.127
Pan Zi! Pan Zi!

00:04:22.088 --> 00:04:23.208
Pan Zi!

00:04:24.288 --> 00:04:25.567
Going down won't help.

00:04:25.567 --> 00:04:26.288
Pan Zi!

00:04:28.127 --> 00:04:29.927
Just finish me off.

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:10.367
He's alive.

00:05:10.928 --> 00:05:12.048
The corpse beetles fear him.

00:05:12.048 --> 00:05:12.968
He's alive.

00:05:14.408 --> 00:05:15.247
Well...

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:17.168
Who is this guy anyway?

00:05:17.768 --> 00:05:19.487
The beetles actually fled.

00:05:28.687 --> 00:05:29.567
Are you okay?

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:30.327
Are you okay?

00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:31.168
- Pan Zi.
- Bro.

00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:32.127
I'm fine.

00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:33.288
Pan Zi.

00:05:33.447 --> 00:05:34.927
Move. It's coming.

00:05:35.007 --> 00:05:35.968
Okay.

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:41.608
Let's go.

00:05:43.048 --> 00:05:44.528
What's chasing us?

00:05:44.624 --> 00:05:45.648
The thing from the kiln.

00:05:45.648 --> 00:05:46.447
What?

00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:47.927
The kiln creature is coming?

00:05:47.927 --> 00:05:49.088
No time for questions.

00:05:49.327 --> 00:05:50.168
Just run.

00:05:50.608 --> 00:05:51.728
Hang on, bro.

00:05:52.007 --> 00:05:53.168
We need to get out fast.

00:05:53.327 --> 00:05:55.327
If that thing catches us,
we're done for.

00:05:58.567 --> 00:05:59.487
Put him down.

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:02.048
Careful.

00:06:02.608 --> 00:06:03.367
Pan Zi.

00:06:04.088 --> 00:06:04.927
Pan Zi.

00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:10.807
I'm sorry.

00:06:16.327 --> 00:06:17.208
It's fine.

00:06:25.608 --> 00:06:26.447
Step aside.

00:06:40.487 --> 00:06:41.567
Help me hold him down.

00:06:45.168 --> 00:06:46.288
Sorry about this, bro.

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:48.408
Try to bear it.

00:06:52.048 --> 00:06:52.968
What are you doing?

00:06:57.447 --> 00:06:59.247
One crawled into his stomach.

00:07:00.127 --> 00:07:01.127
If we don't remove it,

00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:02.327
he'll die.

00:07:04.848 --> 00:07:06.288
His actions just now

00:07:06.288 --> 00:07:07.608
have proven his capability.

00:07:07.608 --> 00:07:08.887
Trusting him is our best bet.

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:22.768
Pan Zi.

00:07:23.127 --> 00:07:23.848
Pan Zi.

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:29.848
Eat this.

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:30.848
It'll help you.

00:07:34.327 --> 00:07:35.088
Listen.

00:07:35.927 --> 00:07:37.136
This wound's pretty deep.

00:07:37.136 --> 00:07:38.807
If not disinfected, it'll get infected.

00:07:38.807 --> 00:07:39.848
I've got a flare here.

00:07:39.848 --> 00:07:41.168
Let's follow the movies' example

00:07:41.608 --> 00:07:43.247
and cauterize his wound.

00:07:43.247 --> 00:07:44.048
How's that?

00:07:44.127 --> 00:07:45.088
You fool!

00:07:45.687 --> 00:07:47.487
Are you trying to kill me?

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.288
Flares contain phosphorus.

00:07:49.288 --> 00:07:50.447
Don't you know anything?

00:07:50.447 --> 00:07:51.447
Not bad.

00:07:51.648 --> 00:07:52.768
Not an amateur, huh?

00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:54.608
I was just kidding.

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:55.728
Trying to make you relax.

00:07:56.168 --> 00:07:56.687
Come on.

00:07:56.687 --> 00:07:57.447
I've got bandages.

00:07:57.447 --> 00:07:58.447
Wrap it tight first.

00:07:58.447 --> 00:07:59.327
Hang in there.

00:07:59.848 --> 00:08:01.327
It's a bit dirty.

00:08:01.327 --> 00:08:02.887
But survival comes first.

00:08:02.887 --> 00:08:03.768
Who are you?

00:08:03.768 --> 00:08:06.048
Not the time for identity crises.

00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:07.088
We just survived together.

00:08:07.088 --> 00:08:08.127
Why would I hurt you now?

00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:09.687
He saved my life, after all.

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:11.528
This wound is too deep.

00:08:11.608 --> 00:08:13.408
We need to tie it tight,
or you'll bleed out.

00:08:13.408 --> 00:08:15.088
You tore my shirt apart.

00:08:15.327 --> 00:08:16.367
Hang in there.

00:08:16.728 --> 00:08:17.567
How's that feel?

00:08:17.807 --> 00:08:19.327
Enjoying the C-section vibes?

00:08:24.528 --> 00:08:25.687
Is that a dinosaur roar?

00:08:26.768 --> 00:08:27.807
Shut off the flashlight.

00:08:34.687 --> 00:08:35.607
What's that?

00:08:44.447 --> 00:08:45.488
Help him up.

00:08:47.368 --> 00:08:48.288
I recognize that sound.

00:08:48.447 --> 00:08:49.727
That thing is coming again.

00:08:50.008 --> 00:08:50.768
Right?

00:08:54.807 --> 00:08:55.528
Run!

00:08:55.807 --> 00:08:56.528
Go.

00:09:55.927 --> 00:09:57.248
Fell again.

00:09:58.368 --> 00:10:00.727
Too many trap floors here.

00:10:02.248 --> 00:10:03.168
We need to be careful.

00:10:03.488 --> 00:10:04.847
No more reckless running.

00:10:05.048 --> 00:10:05.807
Pan Zi.

00:10:06.207 --> 00:10:07.327
Pan Zi, are you okay?

00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:08.128
Pan Zi.

00:10:13.408 --> 00:10:14.727
Came back down the same hole?

00:10:21.727 --> 00:10:22.447
No.

00:10:29.607 --> 00:10:30.368
Not here.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.168
No doors here.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.128
Nor that hole.

00:10:35.847 --> 00:10:37.168
Are those beetles still around?

00:10:37.687 --> 00:10:38.727
With Xiaoge here,

00:10:38.727 --> 00:10:39.967
we shouldn't worry about them.

00:10:40.087 --> 00:10:41.087
Right, Xiaoge?

00:10:43.927 --> 00:10:44.727
Where's Xiaoge?

00:10:46.807 --> 00:10:47.648
Did he

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:48.847
get separated?

00:10:50.648 --> 00:10:51.607
He

00:10:52.368 --> 00:10:54.248
wouldn't fall like we did.

00:10:55.528 --> 00:10:56.447
He's alone.

00:10:56.607 --> 00:10:57.528
He'll be okay, right?

00:10:59.648 --> 00:11:00.967
Listen, kid.

00:11:01.447 --> 00:11:03.607
Stop worrying about Xiaoge.

00:11:03.967 --> 00:11:04.807
He's unstoppable.

00:11:04.807 --> 00:11:06.168
Our worry's wasted on him.

00:11:06.768 --> 00:11:08.768
We can't handle that thing anyway.

00:11:09.327 --> 00:11:10.288
Better stay put

00:11:10.288 --> 00:11:11.727
and not hold him back.

00:11:12.847 --> 00:11:14.648
All the tunnels here are blocked.

00:11:15.368 --> 00:11:17.128
Let's rest here for now.

00:11:19.528 --> 00:11:20.567
Who exactly are you?

00:11:21.567 --> 00:11:23.567
Are you here for Ma's crew too?

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:26.048
His wife hired two teams.

00:11:26.447 --> 00:11:27.168
What?

00:11:27.648 --> 00:11:28.927
Think you're the only hires?

00:11:30.888 --> 00:11:33.288
Mrs. Ma sure cast a wide net.

00:11:41.807 --> 00:11:43.008
Let me introduce myself.

00:11:43.967 --> 00:11:44.927
My surname is Wang.

00:11:45.168 --> 00:11:46.207
Call me Wang Pangzi.

00:11:46.928 --> 00:11:48.567
I rushed out
and forgot my business card.

00:11:50.847 --> 00:11:53.607
I'm famous in exploration circles.

00:11:54.048 --> 00:11:55.128
Since destiny wills it,

00:11:55.128 --> 00:11:56.967
let's team up on this job.

00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:58.368
I don't team up with outsiders.

00:11:59.288 --> 00:12:01.927
Once teamed up, we're not outsiders

00:12:03.888 --> 00:12:05.447
I'll show good faith first.

00:12:06.248 --> 00:12:09.008
Do you know where this place is?

00:12:10.288 --> 00:12:11.368
Isn't this just...

00:12:11.368 --> 00:12:12.288
Where is this place?

00:12:13.207 --> 00:12:14.368
This was built by the ruler

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:16.327
specifically for King Shang of Lu.

00:12:17.207 --> 00:12:18.207
Keep talking.

00:12:19.087 --> 00:12:19.967
Take a guess.

00:12:20.488 --> 00:12:22.607
Why would the ruler build this

00:12:22.607 --> 00:12:23.504
for a mere warlord?

00:12:23.504 --> 00:12:25.128
Because he could summon ghost soldiers.

00:12:25.368 --> 00:12:26.048
Right,

00:12:26.248 --> 00:12:27.368
but not entirely.

00:12:28.607 --> 00:12:29.528
I'm telling you.

00:12:29.847 --> 00:12:31.727
This so-called King Shang of Lu

00:12:32.008 --> 00:12:34.288
and borrowing ghost soldiers

00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:36.447
are actually colossal lies.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:40.648
As for the mysteries
hidden in this kiln,

00:12:41.048 --> 00:12:42.648
if I don't tell you,

00:12:44.207 --> 00:12:46.087
you'll never figure them out.

00:12:46.288 --> 00:12:48.528
Do you know
what King Shang of Lu really did?

00:12:48.528 --> 00:12:50.727
Do you know how
'borrowing ghost soldiers' worked?

00:12:50.888 --> 00:12:53.008
Do you know
what this Gui Seal is used for?

00:12:56.368 --> 00:12:57.768
King Shang of Lu

00:12:58.087 --> 00:13:00.567
sounded fancy as a general,

00:13:00.967 --> 00:13:02.288
but in fact,

00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:05.847
he was just a thief,

00:13:06.447 --> 00:13:07.768
who was utterly depraved

00:13:08.368 --> 00:13:09.567
and acted mysteriously.

00:13:11.488 --> 00:13:13.768
I once read a silk manuscript.

00:13:14.128 --> 00:13:15.567
It documented like this.

00:13:16.648 --> 00:13:18.368
(King Shang of Lu's troops)

00:13:18.648 --> 00:13:21.687
(mostly rested by day
and marched at night.)

00:13:21.888 --> 00:13:24.607
(They would often vanish suddenly,)

00:13:24.768 --> 00:13:26.927
(and then reappear elsewhere.)

00:13:27.447 --> 00:13:28.967
(In places they raided,)

00:13:28.967 --> 00:13:31.567
(alchemists were all killed.)

00:13:31.567 --> 00:13:35.008
(When asked, they claimed
that alchemists mislead the nation.)

00:13:35.727 --> 00:13:36.607
Mislead the nation?

00:13:36.727 --> 00:13:37.888
Impossible.

00:13:37.888 --> 00:13:39.607
Rulers back then were alchemists.

00:13:40.967 --> 00:13:42.207
See?

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.488
I made the same face
when I first heard about it.

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.528
How could we, history scholars,

00:13:47.528 --> 00:13:49.408
ever buy

00:13:49.408 --> 00:13:50.687
such superstitious nonsense?

00:13:51.607 --> 00:13:52.567
So

00:13:53.087 --> 00:13:55.927
they must be
hunting alchemists everywhere,

00:13:56.368 --> 00:14:00.207
especially the legendary ones.

00:14:00.368 --> 00:14:01.128
That is to say,

00:14:01.128 --> 00:14:03.967
King Shang of Lu thought
alchemists misled the nation,

00:14:04.087 --> 00:14:05.888
while in fact,

00:14:05.888 --> 00:14:08.087
he wanted their manuals.

00:14:08.368 --> 00:14:10.567
People back then were gullible,

00:14:11.008 --> 00:14:13.288
so tales grew wilder each retelling.

00:14:14.927 --> 00:14:15.687
Any evidence?

00:14:16.687 --> 00:14:17.607
Evidence?

00:14:18.368 --> 00:14:20.327
Of course, there is evidence.

00:14:20.687 --> 00:14:23.567
Do you remember what we saw earlier,

00:14:23.567 --> 00:14:27.488
seven giant trees
cradling seven alchemy furnaces?

00:14:29.967 --> 00:14:30.648
That

00:14:31.327 --> 00:14:32.248
is the evidence.

00:14:32.687 --> 00:14:35.768
How's alchemy linked
to hunting alchemists?

00:14:35.768 --> 00:14:37.727
Well, it does!

00:14:38.727 --> 00:14:39.888
The Seven-Star

00:14:40.408 --> 00:14:41.847
Alchemy Sect.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:44.048
Seven-Star Alchemy Sect?

00:14:44.888 --> 00:14:45.807
What does that mean?

00:14:49.327 --> 00:14:50.847
My throat's parched from talking.

00:14:52.488 --> 00:14:54.087
I need to refuel.

00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:05.368
Open it.

00:15:12.128 --> 00:15:13.207
(Water)
Well, better.

00:15:13.607 --> 00:15:14.368
Bottoms up.

00:15:22.727 --> 00:15:24.008
Let's continue.

00:15:25.847 --> 00:15:28.687
In ancient times,
there was an alchemy sect

00:15:28.687 --> 00:15:30.687
called the Seven-Star Alchemy Sect.

00:15:30.687 --> 00:15:32.008
(They thought)

00:15:32.008 --> 00:15:33.447
(alchemy took too long,)

00:15:33.447 --> 00:15:34.447
(better to just rob.)

00:15:34.447 --> 00:15:36.768
(So they hunted famed alchemists,)

00:15:37.207 --> 00:15:38.967
(plundering all)

00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:40.327
(of their manuals and elixirs.)

00:15:40.488 --> 00:15:42.888
(They even tested elixirs
on those alchemists.)

00:15:43.168 --> 00:15:45.087
(Some elixirs boosted aggression,)

00:15:45.087 --> 00:15:47.447
(enhancing soldiers' combat skills.)

00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:50.488
(Besides, they always acted at night,)

00:15:50.847 --> 00:15:53.048
(Silk manuscript)
(making it seemed supernatural.)

00:15:53.528 --> 00:15:54.927
(The creepiest part)

00:15:55.408 --> 00:15:58.248
(is the last hierarch
of the Seven-Star Alchemy Sect.)

00:15:58.528 --> 00:16:00.048
Do you know who he was?

00:16:01.087 --> 00:16:01.888
Who?

00:16:04.408 --> 00:16:05.528
Nobody knows.

00:16:05.768 --> 00:16:08.128
Because he was too mysterious.

00:16:08.488 --> 00:16:09.248
So

00:16:09.967 --> 00:16:12.768
there was a saying about him.

00:16:13.528 --> 00:16:14.567
Elusive

00:16:15.687 --> 00:16:16.727
from start

00:16:17.008 --> 00:16:18.567
to finish.

00:16:19.048 --> 00:16:19.927
In short,

00:16:20.207 --> 00:16:21.087
the Unseen.

00:16:22.687 --> 00:16:23.847
I'm talking to you.

00:16:24.687 --> 00:16:26.528
Do you know his connection?

00:16:28.008 --> 00:16:28.888
Keep spinning tales.

00:16:29.847 --> 00:16:31.008
Keep going.

00:16:31.648 --> 00:16:32.888
Are you going to claim

00:16:33.408 --> 00:16:36.168
that the last hierarch
of Seven-Star Alchemy Sect

00:16:36.288 --> 00:16:37.408
was King Shang of Lu?

00:16:37.408 --> 00:16:38.168
Right,

00:16:38.168 --> 00:16:39.207
but not entirely.

00:16:39.368 --> 00:16:40.927
I don't know whether he was a hierarch.

00:16:40.927 --> 00:16:42.567
But King Shang of Lu definitely

00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:44.567
belonged to a branch
of Seven-Star Alchemy Sect.

00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:48.248
You said King Shang of Lu
brewed elixirs here.

00:16:48.248 --> 00:16:49.648
But this was built by the ruler?

00:16:49.648 --> 00:16:50.687
That depends

00:16:51.327 --> 00:16:53.008
on who wrote the silk manuscript.

00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:55.648
It was said to be built by the ruler.

00:16:56.128 --> 00:16:57.528
But is it true?

00:16:57.528 --> 00:16:59.888
It mentioned ghost soldiers.
But did they really exist?

00:17:00.168 --> 00:17:01.687
There aren't that many coincidences.

00:17:02.807 --> 00:17:04.528
Didn't you say the same thing earlier?

00:17:04.528 --> 00:17:07.008
I said that to make the story
more engaging.

00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:08.248
Anyway, I believe this place

00:17:08.248 --> 00:17:09.728
was surely built by King Shang of Lu

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:12.008
to refine elixirs for himself.

00:17:12.288 --> 00:17:13.968
I bet King Shang of Lu's corpse

00:17:13.968 --> 00:17:16.048
is likely inside this kiln.

00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:17.968
Let's bet on it? 100 yuan.

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:19.768
Forget about King Shang of Lu.

00:17:20.928 --> 00:17:22.488
Xiaoge still hasn't returned yet.

00:17:22.928 --> 00:17:24.008
He'll be okay, right?

00:17:25.567 --> 00:17:26.928
It's been way too long.

00:17:26.928 --> 00:17:28.248
I'm afraid Xiaoge

00:17:28.928 --> 00:17:30.367
might have left without us.

00:17:30.607 --> 00:17:31.647
No way.

00:17:31.647 --> 00:17:33.008
Human hearts are unpredictable.

00:17:33.008 --> 00:17:34.208
We need to find a way

00:17:34.208 --> 00:17:35.488
to reunite with Third Master.

00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:36.647
Then we'll deal with Xiaoge.

00:17:36.647 --> 00:17:38.248
So what about our cooperation?

00:17:38.807 --> 00:17:39.807
No cooperation.

00:17:39.807 --> 00:17:41.208
So I've wasted my breath for no...

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:07.567
This must be what attacked me earlier.

00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:33.768
Don't move!

00:18:38.448 --> 00:18:39.248
Young Third Master.

00:18:48.847 --> 00:18:49.647
Are you okay?

00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:51.367
I'm fine.

00:19:16.847 --> 00:19:17.768
Get back here!

00:19:25.048 --> 00:19:26.647
Why do I always get hurt?

00:19:27.632 --> 00:19:29.136
There's a passage behind this wall.

00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:31.208
A passage?

00:19:31.208 --> 00:19:32.167
And there's wind.

00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:33.488
It might lead outside.

00:19:33.488 --> 00:19:34.327
It's real.

00:19:35.408 --> 00:19:36.087
Then don't wait.

00:19:36.087 --> 00:19:36.968
Let's get out of here.

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:37.607
No!

00:19:38.048 --> 00:19:39.344
What if that thing

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:40.624
or corpse beetles are inside?

00:19:40.728 --> 00:19:43.008
That's still better than dying here.

00:19:44.607 --> 00:19:45.768
I have Xiaoge's blood.

00:19:46.704 --> 00:19:47.248
What?

00:19:47.248 --> 00:19:49.328
We have Xiaoge's blood
to deal with corpse beetles.

00:19:49.728 --> 00:19:50.407
What?

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:52.127
To deal with corpse beetles? Where?

00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:56.048
Here it comes again!

00:19:56.768 --> 00:19:57.567
You go first!

00:19:57.728 --> 00:19:59.127
Go! Hurry!

00:20:00.327 --> 00:20:01.288
Move!

00:20:02.528 --> 00:20:03.327
Pan Zi.

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:04.288
Go, Pan Zi.

00:20:05.688 --> 00:20:06.448
Pan Zi.

00:20:06.567 --> 00:20:07.327
Quick.

00:20:12.208 --> 00:20:12.928
This way.

00:20:14.288 --> 00:20:15.008
Go.

00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:18.167
Over here.

00:20:18.167 --> 00:20:19.127
Hurry up, Pangzi.

00:20:27.968 --> 00:20:29.768
You'll definitely be a scumbag someday.

00:20:31.008 --> 00:20:31.688
Pan Zi.

00:20:32.367 --> 00:20:33.087
Pan Zi.

00:20:33.367 --> 00:20:34.728
Wait. Let me explain.

00:20:35.528 --> 00:20:37.248
Over here, Wu Xie. Hurry!

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:37.968
Pangzi.

00:20:37.968 --> 00:20:39.248
Slow down, Pangzi.

00:20:42.087 --> 00:20:43.728
Pangzi, I can't keep up.

00:20:43.728 --> 00:20:44.768
Why did you go down?

00:20:46.367 --> 00:20:47.048
Pangzi.

00:20:47.856 --> 00:20:48.968
- Be careful.
- Don't move, Pangzi.

00:20:49.367 --> 00:20:50.488
Give me your hand.

00:20:50.488 --> 00:20:51.968
I can't reach.

00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:54.968
Who's there?

00:20:55.367 --> 00:20:56.248
Let me come lower.

00:20:59.607 --> 00:21:00.528
Harder.

00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:02.567
Wu Xie, is that you?

00:21:02.567 --> 00:21:03.407
Third Uncle?

00:21:03.407 --> 00:21:04.688
Third Uncle, is that you?

00:21:05.127 --> 00:21:06.288
Who's this?

00:21:06.488 --> 00:21:07.367
Where's Pan Zi?

00:21:07.807 --> 00:21:08.647
Pan Zi.

00:21:08.728 --> 00:21:10.488
- Third Master, I'm here.
- Pan Zi is here.

00:21:10.847 --> 00:21:11.847
But he's injured.

00:21:12.008 --> 00:21:12.887
Where's Xiaoge?

00:21:12.887 --> 00:21:13.887
Who's this guy?

00:21:14.048 --> 00:21:15.288
Why is there an extra person?

00:21:15.488 --> 00:21:17.008
He's also here to rescue Ma.

00:21:17.607 --> 00:21:19.167
Help me, bro!

00:21:19.367 --> 00:21:21.367
I'll kowtow to you later.

00:21:21.528 --> 00:21:22.928
Give me a hand.

00:21:23.087 --> 00:21:24.432
I really can't hold on anymore.

00:21:24.432 --> 00:21:25.808
Third Master, should we help him?

00:21:26.224 --> 00:21:27.376
Pan Zi traveled with him.

00:21:27.376 --> 00:21:29.008
- Save him.
- I'm about to lose my grip.

00:21:30.167 --> 00:21:31.528
Help me, sir.

00:21:31.528 --> 00:21:33.167
Consider yourself lucky today. Come on.

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:33.968
Thanks, sir.

00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:35.327
Wonderful.

00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:36.127
Pangzi, reach out.

00:21:36.127 --> 00:21:37.048
Climb up.

00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:38.728
Reach out.

00:21:40.288 --> 00:21:41.448
Put some muscle into it.

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:43.647
What're you pretending for?

00:21:43.647 --> 00:21:45.367
Can't you use both hands?

00:21:46.928 --> 00:21:47.647
Da Kui.

00:21:48.367 --> 00:21:49.087
Da Kui.

00:21:53.887 --> 00:21:55.488
Why'd you let go, bro?

00:21:56.807 --> 00:21:57.488
Wu Xie.

00:21:57.768 --> 00:21:58.448
Go.

00:21:58.688 --> 00:21:59.367
Wu Xie.

00:22:07.847 --> 00:22:08.607
Don't move.

00:22:21.208 --> 00:22:21.968
Get lost.

00:22:22.847 --> 00:22:23.728
Stay back.

00:22:24.488 --> 00:22:25.248
Get lost.

00:22:35.407 --> 00:22:36.367
Pull me up, quick.

00:22:36.367 --> 00:22:37.008
Hurry.

00:22:38.887 --> 00:22:39.647
Harder.

00:22:43.448 --> 00:22:44.087
Pangzi!

00:22:50.968 --> 00:22:51.807
Pan Zi.

00:22:52.167 --> 00:22:52.928
Pan Zi.

00:22:53.264 --> 00:22:54.327
What's wrong with Pan Zi?

00:22:54.327 --> 00:22:55.087
Wu Xie.

00:22:55.087 --> 00:22:56.327
Pan Zi's been taken.

00:22:56.407 --> 00:22:58.127
Stay put. We're coming.

00:23:04.448 --> 00:23:06.087
Pan Zi! Pan Zi!

00:23:06.607 --> 00:23:07.407
Pan Zi!

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:10.928
I'm not a scumbag.

00:23:11.127 --> 00:23:11.768
Pan Zi.

00:23:13.127 --> 00:23:14.048
Pan Zi.

00:23:15.968 --> 00:23:17.616
Pan Zi. Pan Zi.

00:23:17.616 --> 00:23:18.384
Pan...

00:23:23.968 --> 00:23:24.768
Pan Zi.

00:23:25.567 --> 00:23:26.367
Pan Zi!

00:23:27.167 --> 00:23:28.127
Pan Zi!

00:23:35.647 --> 00:23:36.448
Pan Zi.

00:23:36.607 --> 00:23:37.327
Pan Zi!

00:23:37.407 --> 00:23:38.208
Pan Zi!

00:23:40.327 --> 00:23:41.048
Third Master!

00:24:00.528 --> 00:24:01.847
- Da Kui!
- Third Master!

00:24:07.688 --> 00:24:08.327
Go!

00:24:08.728 --> 00:24:10.048
Go. Go!

00:24:12.887 --> 00:24:14.367
No path left, Third Master.

00:24:20.968 --> 00:24:22.127
They're not coming in.

00:24:22.407 --> 00:24:23.288
Why?

00:24:23.968 --> 00:24:25.488
They don't dare enter here.

00:24:25.887 --> 00:24:27.688
What's different here from outside?

00:24:35.647 --> 00:24:36.887
They're afraid of this.

00:24:37.048 --> 00:24:37.928
Throw this at it!

00:25:19.488 --> 00:25:20.768
Monster!

00:25:21.567 --> 00:25:23.208
Paranormal phenomenon!

00:25:23.208 --> 00:25:23.887
Unknown...

00:25:32.288 --> 00:25:33.807
Don't come any closer!

00:25:50.768 --> 00:25:52.288
The things you've done before...

00:25:52.807 --> 00:25:54.127
(In the days to come,)

00:25:54.647 --> 00:25:56.127
(you must shoulder responsibility.)

00:26:08.928 --> 00:26:09.728
Third Master,

00:26:09.728 --> 00:26:10.807
it's Pan Zi's crossbow.

00:26:19.528 --> 00:26:20.327
Pan Zi!

00:26:20.768 --> 00:26:21.567
Pan Zi!

00:27:23.968 --> 00:27:24.688
Pan Zi.

00:27:24.688 --> 00:27:26.327
Pan Zi, are you okay?

00:27:27.048 --> 00:27:27.768
I'm fine.

00:27:44.928 --> 00:27:45.847
Third Master,

00:27:46.704 --> 00:27:47.884
where is Young Third Master?

00:28:55.844 --> 00:28:58.707
