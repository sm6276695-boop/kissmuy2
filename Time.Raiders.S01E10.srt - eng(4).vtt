00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:55.440
- Hello?
- Hello?

00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:57.469
What were you doing,

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:58.469
not answering my call?

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:00.469
What's wrong?

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.349
Why so urgent?

00:02:04.868 --> 00:02:05.989
Da Kui is dead.

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:09.309
Pan Zi is hospitalized.

00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:11.388
I'm worried about Xie being alone.

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:12.788
What do you mean?

00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:16.912
I'll send you an address.

00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:18.388
Come take over for me.

00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:21.508
You've always handled such matters.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:22.909
What? Where are you going?

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.988
I need to handle my own business.

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:28.309
Is that not allowed?

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.480
Da Kui died.

00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:32.108
You still have personal matters?

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:33.388
What's going on?

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:34.149
Explain clearly.

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:35.828
I'll tell you after I'm done.

00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:36.788
I promise.

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:37.909
Just come here first.

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.189
What's happening exactly?

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.508
Explain it now.

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:45.708
About Wenjin

00:02:45.708 --> 00:02:47.788
and the team's missing 20 years ago,

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.149
I might know what happened.

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:51.708
It was the elevator.

00:02:52.816 --> 00:02:54.869
We never realized back then.

00:02:56.163 --> 00:02:56.816
Hello?

00:02:57.508 --> 00:02:58.388
Can you hear me?

00:02:59.204 --> 00:02:59.986
Hello?

00:03:00.624 --> 00:03:01.136
Hello?

00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:03.438
Hello?

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.108
What do you plan to do?

00:03:09.228 --> 00:03:10.749
I want to revisit that place.

00:03:10.988 --> 00:03:11.909
I'll go this time.

00:03:11.948 --> 00:03:12.948
You can't go.

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:14.668
I'll go this time.

00:03:14.668 --> 00:03:16.268
You mustn't go.

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.189
Listen to me.

00:03:17.508 --> 00:03:19.469
I knew I shouldn't have told you.

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.629
You're too obsessed with this.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.268
I'm not discussing this with you.

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.029
This is my business.

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:27.589
I must handle it myself.

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:28.388
Listen.

00:03:28.388 --> 00:03:29.508
We had an agreement.

00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:30.988
Everything goes according to plan.

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:32.388
What plan?

00:03:32.548 --> 00:03:34.069
The plan is to do as I say.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.828
Otherwise,

00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:36.469
all our agreements become void.

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:37.469
You know what I'll do.

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:38.909
Calm down, will you?

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.069
I'll handle this matter.

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.788
Step back.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:42.708
Okay?

00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:45.784
Hello?

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:47.953
Hello?

00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:18.429
Sorry.

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.549
The number you dialed is unavailable.

00:04:21.908 --> 00:04:23.268
Please try again later.

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:29.789
(After Third Uncle)

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.629
(finished saying that bizarre story,)

00:04:32.148 --> 00:04:33.588
(Third Uncle)
(he disappeared.)

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.148
(I thought he'd return soon.)

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:37.708
(Calling Third Uncle)
(But for half a month,)

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:39.229
(there was no news from him.)

00:04:40.549 --> 00:04:41.588
(I could only ask around)

00:04:41.588 --> 00:04:42.989
(among his circle of friends)

00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:45.148
(about that past incident.)

00:04:45.908 --> 00:04:47.468
(I visited Pan Zi daily,)

00:04:47.828 --> 00:04:49.388
(but he never woke up.)

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.229
(Visiting hours
were only two hours a day.)

00:04:52.908 --> 00:04:54.348
(So for the rest of the time,)

00:04:54.948 --> 00:04:56.229
(I wandered around Pengzhou.)

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:57.069
Come look!

00:04:57.468 --> 00:04:58.749
Take a look!

00:05:00.388 --> 00:05:01.028
Bro,

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:02.429
check these out.

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.109
All genuine goods.

00:05:04.708 --> 00:05:05.869
I've got connections.

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:15.629
You've got a good eye, bro.

00:05:15.908 --> 00:05:18.789
This is my family heirloom.

00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:21.588
Your family heirloom

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.109
is younger than you.

00:05:25.148 --> 00:05:27.148
Don't joke around.

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:29.869
(We deal in antiques)
If you truly want it,

00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:31.908
let's discuss a real price.

00:05:33.588 --> 00:05:34.468
How much?

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:36.229
150,000.

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:37.629
12 yuan.

00:05:41.828 --> 00:05:43.268
Are you here to cause trouble?

00:05:43.549 --> 00:05:44.669
Listen to me.

00:05:45.268 --> 00:05:46.708
I'm in this business too.

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:48.828
This replica is poorly made.

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:50.429
At first glance,

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:52.069
one can tell it's a modern imitation.

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:54.309
8 yuan is already expensive.

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.028
I'll offer 12 yuan,

00:05:56.028 --> 00:05:57.669
and you can make 4 yuan in profit.

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:01.028
Alright.

00:06:04.268 --> 00:06:04.908
Here's the deal,

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:05.429
bro.

00:06:05.588 --> 00:06:06.348
How about this one?

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:07.708
What do you think this is worth?

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:10.148
Machine-carved. 27.

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:13.348
Fine. Wait here.

00:06:18.028 --> 00:06:19.189
Take a look at this.

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:20.669
What's this worth?

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:23.588
Polypropylene.

00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:26.429
Just a big chunk of plastic.

00:06:26.588 --> 00:06:27.429
See here?

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:29.468
There's a crack here.

00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:30.669
Can't plastic crack?

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:33.989
If you don't believe me,

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:35.268
take a lighter

00:06:35.268 --> 00:06:36.189
and try burning it.

00:06:37.388 --> 00:06:38.429
Alright. I'll burn it.

00:06:46.724 --> 00:06:47.804
No wonder

00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:48.944
that guy was so eager

00:06:48.944 --> 00:06:50.364
to dump all this junk on me.

00:06:51.004 --> 00:06:51.924
It's all fake.

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:53.004
Keep it for yourself.

00:06:53.564 --> 00:06:54.323
Bro.

00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:55.883
I'm impressed.

00:06:56.004 --> 00:06:57.684
I'm truly blown away. Okay?

00:06:58.004 --> 00:06:59.724
You seem like a decent guy.

00:06:59.924 --> 00:07:00.604
Tell you what.

00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:01.323
Here.

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:04.244
Today,

00:07:04.443 --> 00:07:06.643
you've taught me a real lesson.

00:07:07.164 --> 00:07:07.804
Thank you.

00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:10.044
To be honest,

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:12.004
back at my place,

00:07:12.323 --> 00:07:13.323
I've got some buddies

00:07:13.443 --> 00:07:15.323
who are just as clueless as me.

00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:16.763
Listen.

00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:18.124
You're such an expert.

00:07:18.484 --> 00:07:20.843
Come by sometime
to check their stuff too.

00:07:21.164 --> 00:07:21.883
Forget it.

00:07:21.883 --> 00:07:26.083
Saving people
is better than building temples.

00:07:26.323 --> 00:07:27.083
Deal?

00:07:42.604 --> 00:07:44.283
What exactly will you do
in that shipwreck?

00:07:46.124 --> 00:07:47.283
I'm not sure yet.

00:07:48.244 --> 00:07:49.724
I'll know when I get there.

00:07:51.684 --> 00:07:53.724
But you demanded huge funding.

00:07:53.724 --> 00:07:55.083
If you don't tell me why,

00:07:55.963 --> 00:07:57.564
I can't explain this to my boss.

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.924
Compared to what you want,

00:08:01.924 --> 00:08:03.044
it's nothing.

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.724
We need all the documents

00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:11.963
on that ship.

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:15.564
No problem.

00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:17.883
I'm after something else.

00:08:19.203 --> 00:08:20.604
This mission's dangerous.

00:08:20.604 --> 00:08:22.364
I'll send two men with you. Okay?

00:08:25.203 --> 00:08:26.323
No problem.

00:08:26.484 --> 00:08:28.083
You're the boss. It's your call.

00:08:56.324 --> 00:08:57.643
A real professional.

00:08:57.724 --> 00:08:59.324
Impressive. Thanks a lot.

00:08:59.883 --> 00:09:00.964
Alright. Take care.

00:09:00.964 --> 00:09:01.484
Okay.

00:09:01.484 --> 00:09:02.403
Come back.

00:09:02.403 --> 00:09:03.444
Next in line.

00:09:03.444 --> 00:09:05.043
(We deal in antiques)

00:09:05.043 --> 00:09:05.923
Alright.

00:09:06.832 --> 00:09:07.724
Young Third Master.

00:09:07.724 --> 00:09:08.643
Take a look.

00:09:08.763 --> 00:09:09.763
It's a quality piece.

00:09:10.004 --> 00:09:11.324
Well?

00:09:11.324 --> 00:09:12.283
Good color and texture.

00:09:14.004 --> 00:09:14.923
Hetian jade.

00:09:15.724 --> 00:09:17.043
No major flaws.

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:18.643
Around 6,000.

00:09:19.324 --> 00:09:20.403
6,000?

00:09:20.604 --> 00:09:21.364
Only 6,000?

00:09:21.364 --> 00:09:23.204
My husband gave me this as a gift.

00:09:23.204 --> 00:09:25.324
He said it cost three hundred thousand.

00:09:26.643 --> 00:09:27.724
Such a huge difference?

00:09:30.283 --> 00:09:31.604
He lied to me!

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:33.004
I'll kill him.

00:09:33.004 --> 00:09:34.444
Calm down, ma'am.

00:09:37.403 --> 00:09:38.563
This one is not bad.

00:09:39.283 --> 00:09:40.163
Check this out.

00:09:40.523 --> 00:09:41.403
This one.

00:09:42.204 --> 00:09:43.084
And this.

00:09:44.163 --> 00:09:45.964
They're all greenhorns.

00:09:46.163 --> 00:09:47.724
Want real treasures?

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:48.923
I know a place.

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:51.923
(Wushanju, Wu Xie)
Wushanju.

00:09:52.084 --> 00:09:53.043
The goods there

00:09:53.043 --> 00:09:54.683
are not top-tier

00:09:54.683 --> 00:09:55.763
but are 100% genuine

00:09:55.763 --> 00:09:56.964
with fair prices.

00:09:57.084 --> 00:09:58.124
Anyone interested?

00:09:58.124 --> 00:09:59.923
- Me!
- Me!

00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:03.244
Form a line.

00:10:03.244 --> 00:10:04.324
Everyone gets a turn.

00:10:06.204 --> 00:10:07.244
Take it easy.

00:10:07.244 --> 00:10:08.324
There's enough for all.

00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:11.204
Sorry.

00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:14.604
The number you dialed is unavailable.

00:10:14.883 --> 00:10:16.683
Please try again later.

00:10:36.763 --> 00:10:37.604
Thief!

00:10:41.444 --> 00:10:42.084
You there!

00:10:42.084 --> 00:10:42.604
Stop!

00:10:47.803 --> 00:10:48.763
Excuse me!

00:10:48.763 --> 00:10:49.523
Coming through!

00:10:51.364 --> 00:10:51.844
You okay?

00:10:53.244 --> 00:10:54.324
Don't do anything stupid!

00:10:59.204 --> 00:10:59.964
Stay there!

00:11:04.124 --> 00:11:04.883
Stop!

00:11:06.283 --> 00:11:07.043
Stop!

00:11:12.683 --> 00:11:13.563
Stop!

00:11:16.124 --> 00:11:17.004
Stop!

00:11:19.724 --> 00:11:20.484
Give it back.

00:11:21.844 --> 00:11:22.324
Return it.

00:11:22.324 --> 00:11:23.244
Sorry about this.

00:11:23.844 --> 00:11:24.364
Give it back.

00:11:24.364 --> 00:11:25.403
I'll give you the phone.

00:11:25.844 --> 00:11:27.844
Here you go, buddy.

00:11:34.204 --> 00:11:35.163
Dropped your knife too?

00:11:35.163 --> 00:11:36.163
With brains like that,

00:11:36.604 --> 00:11:38.004
you should quit thieving.

00:11:38.004 --> 00:11:38.724
Buddy.

00:11:38.724 --> 00:11:39.763
Go straight.

00:11:39.763 --> 00:11:40.364
Okay.

00:11:52.324 --> 00:11:54.000
(Third Uncle)

00:12:03.444 --> 00:12:04.324
Ms. Ning,

00:12:05.563 --> 00:12:07.403
his phone's clean.

00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:13.968
(Third Uncle)

00:12:19.844 --> 00:12:20.724
Return it.

00:12:22.563 --> 00:12:23.444
Understood.

00:12:33.444 --> 00:12:35.283
(I finally got some leads.)

00:12:35.484 --> 00:12:37.523
(After Ms. Wenjin
and the others disappeared,)

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:39.124
(the police investigated for years.)

00:12:39.923 --> 00:12:41.964
(Third Uncle was obsessed
during that time.)

00:12:41.964 --> 00:12:43.004
(He kept searching.)

00:12:44.364 --> 00:12:46.484
(Due to unsolved mysteries in the case)

00:12:47.204 --> 00:12:49.043
(and for Third Uncle's safety's sake,)

00:12:49.163 --> 00:12:51.283
(the police kept details from him.)

00:12:52.484 --> 00:12:54.204
(I still can't reach Third Uncle.)

00:12:55.523 --> 00:12:56.763
(He's gone dark before)

00:12:56.763 --> 00:12:58.403
(for days at a time,)

00:12:58.923 --> 00:13:00.763
(but never this long.)

00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:05.604
(Third Uncle,
your fish is still with me.)

00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:06.964
(I'm worried sick)

00:13:07.004 --> 00:13:08.763
(but powerless to help.)

00:13:09.484 --> 00:13:11.084
(I'll take it to the antique market)
(Where has Third Uncle gone?)

00:13:11.403 --> 00:13:12.803
(Why isn't he replying?)

00:13:16.084 --> 00:13:16.883
(I keep thinking)

00:13:16.883 --> 00:13:18.604
(about what he said before leaving.)

00:13:19.163 --> 00:13:21.084
I understand
what happened back then now.

00:13:23.763 --> 00:13:24.964
The elevator.

00:13:27.563 --> 00:13:29.244
That elevator had issues.

00:13:29.283 --> 00:13:31.084
(The elevator had issues?)

00:13:31.604 --> 00:13:33.403
(What did Third Uncle mean?)

00:13:34.283 --> 00:13:36.643
(He's searched for Ms. Wenjin
for 20 years,)

00:13:37.403 --> 00:13:39.244
(finally piecing clues together,)

00:13:39.523 --> 00:13:41.324
(only for the same copper fish)

00:13:41.324 --> 00:13:43.244
(to resurface now.)

00:13:46.244 --> 00:13:47.683
(I can't shake this feeling)

00:13:48.683 --> 00:13:50.844
(that something terrible is coming.)

00:13:52.244 --> 00:13:53.124
(Third Uncle,)

00:13:54.724 --> 00:13:55.844
(Where have you been?)
(where are you?)

00:14:05.859 --> 00:14:06.480
Hello?

00:14:07.364 --> 00:14:09.084
Do you know Wu Sanxing?

00:14:09.283 --> 00:14:09.964
Yeah, I do.

00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:11.444
He's missing.

00:14:15.523 --> 00:14:16.604
(Who are you people?)

00:14:17.043 --> 00:14:18.283
(What's happening?)

00:14:18.403 --> 00:14:19.084
(We're)

00:14:19.084 --> 00:14:21.204
(an international marine resource
development firm.)

00:14:21.923 --> 00:14:23.563
(We analyze shipping routes)

00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:24.643
(and historical records)

00:14:25.124 --> 00:14:27.364
(to locate ancient shipwrecks,)

00:14:27.523 --> 00:14:28.364
(salvage artifacts,)

00:14:28.964 --> 00:14:30.523
(and auction relics)

00:14:30.643 --> 00:14:32.803
(to museums or collectors.)

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.400
(Wu Sanxing was seeking
an underwater shipwreck.)

00:14:36.724 --> 00:14:37.883
(He secured our equipment)

00:14:38.004 --> 00:14:39.803
(and personnel through collateral)

00:14:40.283 --> 00:14:42.364
(to form a five-man team.)

00:14:42.724 --> 00:14:43.763
(But)

00:14:44.124 --> 00:14:45.724
(on their fifth day at sea,)

00:14:45.724 --> 00:14:47.004
(all communications were lost.)

00:14:48.163 --> 00:14:49.563
(We launched rescue ops)

00:14:49.563 --> 00:14:50.604
(Inbox: empty)
(in that area)

00:14:51.043 --> 00:14:52.403
(but found nothing.)

00:14:55.563 --> 00:14:56.324
(Did they)

00:14:56.324 --> 00:14:58.043
(leave clues before disappearing?)

00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:00.043
(We confirmed)

00:15:00.043 --> 00:15:01.964
(three hours before disappearing,)

00:15:02.523 --> 00:15:04.563
(Wu Sanxing and two others)

00:15:04.563 --> 00:15:06.403
(entered the underwater shipwreck.)

00:15:06.763 --> 00:15:07.724
(They've been missing)

00:15:08.204 --> 00:15:09.484
(for ten days by now.)

00:15:10.844 --> 00:15:11.803
(Your corporation)

00:15:11.803 --> 00:15:13.683
(should handle rescues.)

00:15:13.683 --> 00:15:14.763
(Why contact me?)

00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.964
(Wu Sanxing listed you
as his emergency contact,)

00:15:19.283 --> 00:15:20.803
(saying if anything happened,)

00:15:20.803 --> 00:15:21.883
(we could use your help.)

00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:23.923
(Currently, we can't confirm)

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.124
(the status of that shipwreck)

00:15:25.683 --> 00:15:27.484
(and whether those three
are alive or dead.)

00:15:28.604 --> 00:15:30.523
(So we're organizing another team)

00:15:30.604 --> 00:15:31.683
(to investigate.)

00:15:32.964 --> 00:15:34.283
(Time isn't on our side.)

00:15:34.724 --> 00:15:35.763
(The area will soon enter)

00:15:35.763 --> 00:15:36.883
(a 15-day storm season.)

00:15:37.244 --> 00:15:38.084
(By then,)

00:15:38.244 --> 00:15:39.683
(we'll have to abort the mission.)

00:15:41.204 --> 00:15:42.444
(This concerns your family.)

00:15:42.964 --> 00:15:43.883
(What's your decision?)

00:15:44.563 --> 00:15:45.683
(What's your name?)

00:15:46.604 --> 00:15:47.643
(Ning.)

00:16:02.043 --> 00:16:02.803
Hello.

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:04.084
I'm Ning.

00:16:06.523 --> 00:16:07.283
Wu Xie.

00:16:07.563 --> 00:16:08.484
Follow me.

00:16:10.604 --> 00:16:12.004
This operation is critical.

00:16:12.163 --> 00:16:13.124
So besides you,

00:16:13.244 --> 00:16:14.763
we've invited some other consultants.

00:16:16.803 --> 00:16:18.004
An honor to meet you.

00:16:18.084 --> 00:16:19.204
My surname is Zhang.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:20.444
Wu Xie.

00:16:20.683 --> 00:16:21.364
Hello.

00:16:21.803 --> 00:16:22.844
Mr. Zhang is our company's

00:16:22.844 --> 00:16:23.964
assigned consultant.

00:16:23.964 --> 00:16:26.163
He's an expert in ancient shipwrecks.

00:16:26.563 --> 00:16:27.724
He will lead the analysis

00:16:27.724 --> 00:16:29.043
of the shipwreck's condition.

00:16:29.444 --> 00:16:30.163
Nice to meet you.

00:16:31.163 --> 00:16:32.163
You two talk first.

00:16:36.724 --> 00:16:38.204
Please, have a seat here.

00:16:47.283 --> 00:16:49.084
May I ask under what capacity

00:16:49.084 --> 00:16:51.244
you were invited this time?

00:16:51.763 --> 00:16:53.883
Your field of study

00:16:53.964 --> 00:16:55.043
seems rather niche.

00:16:55.324 --> 00:16:57.803
I haven't seen your byline

00:16:57.883 --> 00:16:59.763
in any academic journals.

00:17:00.763 --> 00:17:01.763
I specialize

00:17:01.763 --> 00:17:02.604
in excavation.

00:17:03.163 --> 00:17:04.283
You're an architect?

00:17:04.724 --> 00:17:05.684
Not an architect.

00:17:06.204 --> 00:17:07.283
I'm an excavation worker.

00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:08.803
That shipwreck you'll study

00:17:08.884 --> 00:17:10.283
needs excavation before analysis.

00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:11.244
But currently,

00:17:11.244 --> 00:17:12.603
whether you'll get the chance

00:17:12.724 --> 00:17:14.004
depends on the conditions.

00:17:14.004 --> 00:17:15.283
If conditions prove unfavorable,

00:17:15.843 --> 00:17:16.924
access won't be available.

00:17:18.603 --> 00:17:21.083
It seems like
your role is indeed crucial.

00:17:24.004 --> 00:17:25.164
Here's my business card.

00:17:26.123 --> 00:17:27.404
More friends mean more chances.

00:17:27.523 --> 00:17:28.563
Contact me in need

00:17:28.684 --> 00:17:29.964
if you ever visit the north.

00:17:30.283 --> 00:17:31.644
(Zhang Guangming)
My reputation in academia

00:17:31.644 --> 00:17:32.724
is quite distinguished.

00:17:34.268 --> 00:17:35.888
(Big Talker, Professional, Trustworthy)

00:17:42.283 --> 00:17:43.323
That scoundrel.

00:17:43.484 --> 00:17:44.444
Wang Pangzi!

00:17:45.444 --> 00:17:46.123
Wang Pangzi!

00:17:46.123 --> 00:17:48.083
What's all the racket about?

00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:50.563
I am here nominating you

00:17:50.644 --> 00:17:52.964
for the Big Talker Oscar.

00:17:53.123 --> 00:17:54.164
Wang Pangzi?

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:56.283
Wu!

00:17:57.684 --> 00:17:59.363
Long time no see, bro.

00:18:00.004 --> 00:18:01.004
You look leaner.

00:18:01.644 --> 00:18:02.763
Wang Pangzi, tell me.

00:18:02.964 --> 00:18:04.444
Why did you vandalize

00:18:04.444 --> 00:18:05.444
my business card?

00:18:05.803 --> 00:18:06.724
Why?

00:18:06.724 --> 00:18:07.843
You've gone too far!

00:18:08.244 --> 00:18:09.444
Alright.

00:18:09.884 --> 00:18:11.563
A respected professor

00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:13.204
can't read Chinese?

00:18:13.204 --> 00:18:14.204
Let me read it for you.

00:18:14.964 --> 00:18:16.484
Big Talker.

00:18:16.644 --> 00:18:17.444
Professional.

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:18.803
Trustworthy.

00:18:19.924 --> 00:18:20.644
Awesome.

00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:22.444
Keep it safe.

00:18:22.884 --> 00:18:23.884
My calligraphy

00:18:24.164 --> 00:18:25.964
is worth millions.

00:18:26.803 --> 00:18:27.964
Here, have breakfast.

00:18:28.924 --> 00:18:30.363
Let me catch up with my buddy.

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:31.444
Come.

00:18:32.484 --> 00:18:33.884
What's this stench?

00:18:34.884 --> 00:18:36.644
It's premium healthy food.

00:18:36.724 --> 00:18:38.123
Don't underestimate boldness.

00:18:38.323 --> 00:18:40.484
No hair means a weak constitution.

00:18:41.043 --> 00:18:42.644
Clearly you've got kidney deficiency.

00:18:42.924 --> 00:18:44.724
It's specially made for you.

00:18:45.323 --> 00:18:47.323
Fusion of durian
and river snail rice noodles.

00:18:48.563 --> 00:18:49.523
Ultimate nourishment.

00:18:49.803 --> 00:18:50.803
Eat up.

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:53.123
Let's go.

00:18:55.803 --> 00:18:56.763
Scoundrel!

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:04.323
So

00:19:04.884 --> 00:19:07.123
Pan Zi is still in the hospital
unconscious?

00:19:08.603 --> 00:19:09.964
I've hired a caregiver for him.

00:19:10.684 --> 00:19:12.363
My shop assistant has rushed there too.

00:19:12.964 --> 00:19:14.123
As soon as Pan Zi wakes up,

00:19:15.083 --> 00:19:16.523
he'll message me immediately.

00:19:18.363 --> 00:19:19.924
When traveling, we're at fate's mercy.

00:19:19.924 --> 00:19:21.684
Nobody wants this kind of thing.

00:19:22.283 --> 00:19:23.843
Don't overthink it.

00:19:24.523 --> 00:19:25.843
But I never expected

00:19:25.843 --> 00:19:27.763
you'd take another job so quickly.

00:19:28.244 --> 00:19:30.363
Ms. Ning must be paying well.

00:19:30.523 --> 00:19:31.724
How much does she pay you?

00:19:35.644 --> 00:19:37.164
Fine, I'm leaving.

00:19:37.164 --> 00:19:38.244
Treating me as a stranger?

00:19:44.444 --> 00:19:45.484
100,000?

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:47.484
500,000?

00:19:48.644 --> 00:19:49.563
A million?

00:19:49.603 --> 00:19:50.684
Not a single cent.

00:19:51.763 --> 00:19:52.843
Then why are you here?

00:19:54.164 --> 00:19:55.083
For a date?

00:19:55.244 --> 00:19:55.964
Shut it.

00:20:01.843 --> 00:20:02.684
I'm here

00:20:03.004 --> 00:20:05.043
because Third Uncle partnered
with their company

00:20:05.043 --> 00:20:06.803
to find an underwater shipwreck.

00:20:07.004 --> 00:20:08.444
Now he's gone missing.

00:20:09.004 --> 00:20:10.323
I need to go somewhere.

00:20:11.363 --> 00:20:11.724
What?

00:20:11.724 --> 00:20:12.404
Don't follow me.

00:20:12.404 --> 00:20:13.523
Stay and care for Pan Zi.

00:20:13.644 --> 00:20:14.884
Wait, Third Uncle.

00:20:19.444 --> 00:20:20.684
I must find him.

00:20:21.444 --> 00:20:22.763
Your third uncle is missing?

00:20:23.123 --> 00:20:25.004
You should've said so earlier.

00:20:25.244 --> 00:20:26.444
So our real mission

00:20:26.444 --> 00:20:27.884
is finding him for you?

00:20:28.204 --> 00:20:28.884
Wait.

00:20:29.244 --> 00:20:30.404
You didn't know he was gone?

00:20:30.404 --> 00:20:31.164
Why are you here?

00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:32.444
I didn't know before,

00:20:32.684 --> 00:20:34.763
but now I'm here to help you find him.

00:20:40.123 --> 00:20:41.803
Shipwreck salvage.

00:20:41.803 --> 00:20:43.763
Underwater welding and construction.

00:20:43.843 --> 00:20:44.843
Diving engineering.

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:47.244
And underwater rescue
company's chairman.

00:20:47.523 --> 00:20:48.484
Wang Yueban?

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:50.083
That's me.

00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:54.444
You've got many skills.

00:20:54.444 --> 00:20:55.748
(Wang Yueban)

00:20:56.283 --> 00:20:57.563
If I weren't skilled,

00:20:58.244 --> 00:20:59.563
who'd help find your third uncle?

00:21:02.523 --> 00:21:03.964
Relax, kid.

00:21:04.283 --> 00:21:05.763
Now that I'm here,

00:21:06.043 --> 00:21:07.363
not just your third uncle,

00:21:08.644 --> 00:21:10.004
I'll even find

00:21:10.004 --> 00:21:12.204
your third aunt and third great-aunt.

00:21:14.763 --> 00:21:15.843
Just rest assured.

00:21:21.043 --> 00:21:22.603
(Let me brief you.)

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:24.803
Before Wu Sanxing left, he said

00:21:24.964 --> 00:21:26.244
he was searching for an island.

00:21:26.964 --> 00:21:29.004
(Map)
He marked four possible zones.

00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:30.523
But the areas are too vast.

00:21:30.644 --> 00:21:31.763
Searching all of them

00:21:31.924 --> 00:21:33.004
would take two years.

00:21:34.083 --> 00:21:36.964
Worse, storm season's approaching.

00:21:37.204 --> 00:21:38.563
Once storms hit,

00:21:38.803 --> 00:21:40.323
all ships will stop sailing.

00:21:40.323 --> 00:21:42.043
So we've got one week at most.

00:21:42.043 --> 00:21:43.363
A two-year search in one week?

00:21:43.363 --> 00:21:44.244
You're joking.

00:21:44.724 --> 00:21:45.404
Therefore,

00:21:45.603 --> 00:21:47.803
using ancient shipping routes

00:21:48.123 --> 00:21:49.924
and common wreck locations

00:21:49.924 --> 00:21:51.484
due to stranding,

00:21:51.563 --> 00:21:53.803
I've narrowed the search areas.

00:21:53.924 --> 00:21:54.724
Take a look.

00:21:55.484 --> 00:21:56.444
Your new map

00:21:56.924 --> 00:21:57.964
is ultra-precise.

00:21:58.924 --> 00:22:00.043
It might take us six months

00:22:00.043 --> 00:22:01.204
to actually find anything.

00:22:01.724 --> 00:22:03.363
Professor Zhang's clues

00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:04.644
should save us

00:22:04.644 --> 00:22:06.043
three times the effort.

00:22:06.644 --> 00:22:07.404
Right.

00:22:08.843 --> 00:22:11.283
For someone underwater,

00:22:11.563 --> 00:22:13.964
six months and two years are the same.

00:22:15.004 --> 00:22:16.484
They both mean being waterlogged.

00:22:17.684 --> 00:22:19.164
You got better ideas?

00:22:21.164 --> 00:22:22.484
You didn't hire me.

00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:24.444
Besides, you're the shipwreck expert,

00:22:24.603 --> 00:22:25.763
and I handle rescues.

00:22:26.204 --> 00:22:26.884
I

00:22:26.884 --> 00:22:29.603
only advise within my expertise.

00:22:31.363 --> 00:22:32.283
Ms. Ning,

00:22:32.563 --> 00:22:35.563
besides diving gear,

00:22:35.644 --> 00:22:37.603
let's pack extra clothing.

00:22:38.004 --> 00:22:39.484
Ever seen Titanic?

00:22:39.803 --> 00:22:41.884
Shipwreck victims

00:22:42.004 --> 00:22:44.164
freeze before drowning.

00:22:45.763 --> 00:22:46.884
I'll arrange it.

00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:49.043
Just pinpoint the location

00:22:50.763 --> 00:22:53.323
and leave the rest to me.

00:22:55.924 --> 00:22:57.164
I mean, my boss,

00:22:57.724 --> 00:22:58.684
Ms. Ning.

00:23:01.283 --> 00:23:02.043
Don't worry.

00:23:02.123 --> 00:23:03.164
The precise location

00:23:05.204 --> 00:23:06.204
is on Wu Xie.

00:23:07.363 --> 00:23:08.164
Me?

00:23:10.843 --> 00:23:12.724
You're Wu Sanxing's emergency contact.

00:23:13.004 --> 00:23:14.724
Only you might know the location.

00:23:14.964 --> 00:23:16.244
So don't hide anything.

00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:18.523
Among those missing
with Wu Sanxing this time,

00:23:18.924 --> 00:23:19.563
one is

00:23:19.563 --> 00:23:21.164
our Ocean Company's heir.

00:23:22.004 --> 00:23:22.484
That's why

00:23:22.484 --> 00:23:24.244
they allocated such a huge rescue fund.

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:26.363
But honestly,

00:23:26.603 --> 00:23:27.843
I'm just an employee.

00:23:28.484 --> 00:23:30.083
If we truly can't complete the mission,

00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:31.684
I'll have to report empty-handed.

00:23:32.323 --> 00:23:33.644
So whether to save them

00:23:33.843 --> 00:23:35.123
depends entirely on you.

00:23:35.644 --> 00:23:37.123
All our current operation

00:23:37.444 --> 00:23:38.964
is based on your knowledge

00:23:38.964 --> 00:23:40.644
or ability to locate that shipwreck.

00:23:41.244 --> 00:23:42.283
But if you can't help,

00:23:42.924 --> 00:23:44.603
I'll have to terminate the operation.

00:23:45.204 --> 00:23:48.563
So can you do it or not?

00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:50.803
I...

00:23:51.043 --> 00:23:52.484
will definitely find it.

00:23:52.803 --> 00:23:54.884
My third uncle did tell me some things.

00:23:55.603 --> 00:23:57.843
But the clues you've given me
are insufficient.

00:23:59.204 --> 00:24:00.404
What clues do you need?

00:24:02.444 --> 00:24:03.843
For instance,

00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:04.884
well,

00:24:05.244 --> 00:24:06.484
the photos of these waters.

00:24:07.363 --> 00:24:08.123
We have them.

00:24:22.123 --> 00:24:24.484
These are photos of all islands
in this maritime area.

00:24:26.204 --> 00:24:27.404
You need to give me time.

00:24:27.484 --> 00:24:28.404
I need to review them.

00:24:29.724 --> 00:24:30.924
We're running out of time.

00:24:33.043 --> 00:24:34.004
I can locate the island

00:24:34.004 --> 00:24:35.123
Third Uncle visited.

00:24:36.164 --> 00:24:37.204
There are too many photos.

00:24:37.204 --> 00:24:38.363
So

00:24:39.283 --> 00:24:40.523
I need assistance.

00:24:41.043 --> 00:24:42.083
Everyone here

00:24:42.884 --> 00:24:44.123
is at your disposal.

00:24:51.644 --> 00:24:52.684
What are you waiting for?

00:24:52.684 --> 00:24:54.404
Start looking, Baldy.

00:24:54.563 --> 00:24:55.763
Don't zone out now.

00:24:56.004 --> 00:24:56.843
First,

00:24:57.123 --> 00:24:58.244
the island we're seeking

00:24:58.363 --> 00:25:00.123
has both forests and reefs.

00:25:05.884 --> 00:25:08.083
It was submerged before.

00:25:08.444 --> 00:25:09.523
So its vegetation

00:25:09.523 --> 00:25:10.924
is no older than 20 years.

00:25:19.843 --> 00:25:21.043
(It's a remote island.)

00:25:21.404 --> 00:25:22.404
(No other islands)

00:25:22.484 --> 00:25:23.763
are within 200 nautical miles.

00:25:34.004 --> 00:25:34.684
Professor Zhang,

00:25:34.843 --> 00:25:35.724
look at these five.

00:25:36.404 --> 00:25:36.964
Which one

00:25:36.964 --> 00:25:38.404
matches your ancient sea route map?

00:25:38.404 --> 00:25:40.563
These two are within my marked area.

00:25:41.283 --> 00:25:42.204
Well, Wu?

00:25:42.803 --> 00:25:43.563
Can you determine

00:25:43.644 --> 00:25:44.724
which one it is?

00:25:55.484 --> 00:25:57.283
(We can't visit both locations.)

00:25:57.644 --> 00:25:59.884
(Two islands
might as well be a hundred.)

00:26:00.083 --> 00:26:02.043
We still can't pinpoint the location.

00:26:02.164 --> 00:26:03.244
Did anyone ask you?

00:26:03.523 --> 00:26:04.884
Stop your blabbering.

00:26:04.964 --> 00:26:05.803
Showing off again?

00:26:05.803 --> 00:26:07.523
Why are you so agitated?

00:26:07.803 --> 00:26:09.404
You're disrupting his concentration.

00:26:09.884 --> 00:26:10.843
Will your words help?

00:26:10.843 --> 00:26:12.004
All that gibberish about 100.

00:26:12.004 --> 00:26:13.204
Enough. Stop arguing.

00:26:13.684 --> 00:26:14.363
I found it.

00:26:20.803 --> 00:26:21.924
You know the location?

00:26:31.884 --> 00:26:33.004
Are you sure?

00:26:41.363 --> 00:26:42.083
Yong!

00:26:44.843 --> 00:26:45.603
Yes, boss?

00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:49.004
Tell the captain to sail to this site

00:26:49.004 --> 00:26:49.724
at full speed.

00:26:49.803 --> 00:26:50.644
Okay!

00:26:51.724 --> 00:26:52.523
Thank you all.

00:26:52.523 --> 00:26:53.444
You may rest now.

00:26:54.283 --> 00:26:55.083
Great.

00:26:55.924 --> 00:26:58.164
I saw lots of fish at the bow earlier.

00:26:58.644 --> 00:26:59.924
I'll pick a big one.

00:27:00.244 --> 00:27:02.043
How about making stone-pot fish
for dinner?

00:27:03.164 --> 00:27:04.083
Or pickled fish?

00:27:04.083 --> 00:27:05.603
I'm getting hungry too.

00:27:05.603 --> 00:27:06.884
Or chopped chili fish head?

00:27:07.644 --> 00:27:08.083
Good.

00:27:08.083 --> 00:27:08.964
Enough talking.

00:27:08.964 --> 00:27:09.884
Get cooking.

00:27:11.244 --> 00:27:12.083
By the way, Wu Xie,

00:27:13.803 --> 00:27:14.884
before Wu Sanxing left,

00:27:14.884 --> 00:27:15.964
he left a bag behind.

00:27:15.964 --> 00:27:17.004
I left it on your bed.

00:27:20.444 --> 00:27:21.924
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:27:23.244 --> 00:27:24.444
We've checked the bag.

00:27:24.563 --> 00:27:25.603
There are no clues in it.

00:27:26.803 --> 00:27:28.843
You went through my third uncle's bag?

00:28:21.964 --> 00:28:22.763
What are you doing?

00:28:24.964 --> 00:28:26.123
I'm drinking tea.

00:28:26.244 --> 00:28:27.523
Drinking tea?

00:28:27.884 --> 00:28:28.884
Quit fooling around.

00:28:29.323 --> 00:28:30.724
I can smell alcohol.

00:28:38.803 --> 00:28:40.043
Guangliang?

00:28:48.083 --> 00:28:51.484
Seize joy when life favors you.

00:28:52.004 --> 00:28:54.884
Always drain your cup when drinking.

00:28:56.724 --> 00:28:57.523
Bottoms up!

00:28:57.523 --> 00:28:58.323
Bro,

00:28:58.484 --> 00:28:59.283
you know what?

00:28:59.283 --> 00:29:01.563
You have been too mean to me.

00:29:01.644 --> 00:29:03.164
You constantly pick on me!

00:29:03.204 --> 00:29:04.404
I'm sorry, bro.

00:29:04.803 --> 00:29:06.803
Drink this, and we're sworn brothers.

00:29:07.563 --> 00:29:08.164
Come on.

00:29:08.244 --> 00:29:09.283
Chug it all?

00:29:09.444 --> 00:29:10.884
Absolutely. Cheers!

00:30:40.899 --> 00:30:42.608

is Xiaoge?

00:31:14.323 --> 00:31:16.603
I only know his surname is Zhang.

00:31:16.603 --> 00:31:18.123
We don't ask questions.

00:31:19.724 --> 00:31:20.843
