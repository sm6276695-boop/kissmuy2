(I Want You)

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.880
Feng?

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.120
Feng?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.120
Should I call you Ji Qingci

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.800
or Mu Ling...

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.560
My bad, Lord Divine Beast.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.080
I'll warm your bed tonight.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.040
Wash yourself clean.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.440
Make sure it's clean.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.520
A bunch of useless fools.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.040
They can't even kill a mere woman.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
The heiress of Lord Yi's Residence
can only be me.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.320
I will let her know,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.320
even though she's come back,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.120
she's walking right into the trap.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.520
But

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.400
how did she get

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.840
the other half of the pendant?

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.040
Didn't she bring

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640
a good-looking guard with her

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.800
earlier today?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.600
She's been outside for years

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.640
and might pick up bad habits.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.200
Next,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.960
there will be a good show.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600
As expected.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.840
Jealousy makes people beautiful.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.720
Everyone says my red hair
is an ill omen,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.120
but Father and Mother say
it's a blessing.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.840
I like my hair though.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.560
Yuanying.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.880
Come on here, Yuanying.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.520
Look, there are fish.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.920
I won't accept my fate.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.720
I don't want to be
an illegitimate daughter forever.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.640
What are you saying?

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.560
I failed to save you back then.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.600
Yet fate turned it into a chance
for my revenge.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.200
Retribution.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800
Ji Qingci,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.400
I'll avenge you too.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.800
(Is this the summoning spell?)

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.960
(Legend says in ancient times,)

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.300
(the pact between humans and deities
brings forth the summoning spell.)

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.400
You were peeking!

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.320
I look better than you.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.200
How did you suddenly fall into the pool?

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.240
Think about what you did just now.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.840
Could it be...

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.000
The summoning spell exists, Feng?

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.400
Do not

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.320
sneeze again.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.000
Also,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.040
stop calling me Feng.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.560
My name is Chi Yu.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.280
The Silver Fox Clan's talisman.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.200
There's someone
from the Silver Fox Clan

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.680
in Lord Yi's Residence.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.240
Silver Fox Clan?

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.160
The culprit who froze your whole clan?

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.160
He can catch my Silver Fox Talisman.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.800
He's not a mortal?

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.120
Put your clothes on.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.120
Bai Li,

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.960
I will cut you to pieces
with my own hands.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.720
What's wrong, Chi Yu?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.640
(Get away.)

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.920
(Leave my body!)

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.200
(Foolish.)

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.160
(Don't you know
that once a pact is formed,)

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.480
(you'd lose spirit power?)

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.200
(Besides,)

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.400
(It's the Silver Fox Clan's
bewitching spell.)

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.480
(I said get out of my body.)

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.240
(Chi Yu,)

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.000
(follow your desire.)

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.280
Chi Yu, wake up.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.440
What are you doing?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.960
What did you call me?

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.640
Phoenix Chi Yu.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.080
Lord Divine Beast.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.360
Ice Beauty.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.920
Ice Beauty?

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.880
I like that.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.800
You seem

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.160
like a different person.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.360
Isn't that a good thing?

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.560
I want you...

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.720
To cooperate with me.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.000
I can grant all your wishes.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.240
No.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.560
You're not Chi Yu.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.480
Oh, you caught me.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.560
The power of the Xuanzhu Jade
in your blood

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.600
can make me stronger.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.040
(What's wrong with me?)

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.360
(Wake up.)

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.320
I'm sorry.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.880
I was hit

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.920
by the Silver Fox Clan's...

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.880
Yuanying, you came uninvited.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.800
Are you alone?

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.680
How many people

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.840
do you think would be here?

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.400
Or

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.400
is your visit

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.320
actually about someone else?

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.560
Of course not.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.680
Father will host a welcoming banquet

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.280
for you tomorrow.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.440
His Majesty will attend.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.360
I brought

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.880
some newly made clothes

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.240
for you to pick.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.080
That's thoughtful, Yuanying.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.320
You could've sent the servants.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.560
There's no need to trouble yourself.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.960
That said,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.360
if there really are others here,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.080
what will you do?

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.480
You sound like I'm a stranger.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.240
Well then,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.240
I'll let you rest.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.760
(Lord Yi's Residence)

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.280
His Majesty arrives.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.680
- Long live the Emperor!
- Long live the Emperor!

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.120
You may rise.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.840
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.120
(Ji Yuchen, Emperor)
I came

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.120
because I heard Qingci was found.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.560
I'd like to congratulate you, Uncle.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.200
Your arrival

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.480
is the utmost honor

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.800
to my residence.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.920
Do away with the formalities, Uncle.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.800
Please sit.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.960
Princess Qingci arrives.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.280
You may rise.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.800
It's your blessing

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.040
that Qingci has returned.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.680
However, I've heard

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.720
people who go through great ordeals

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.680
often change a lot

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.360
in habits and temperament.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.680
Just like Qingci,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.680
I find her

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.680
rather strange now.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.320
Really?

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.160
I see no change

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.320
in you.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.560
After many years,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.520
seeing Your Majesty and Father again,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.040
you still feel the same to me.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.120
Yes.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.400
You've been away

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.120
for so long,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.320
habits and temperament

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.680
may change.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.800
Some things change,

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.680
some do not.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.560
Like

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.520
scars on the body.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.640
Father,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.880
Qingci was wounded by an arrow

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.320
during the imperial hunt
when she was a child.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.640
Do you remember?

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.520
But when I glanced yesterday,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.800
I noticed she no longer

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.640
had the scar.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.480
Thank you for your concern.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.240
But after so many years,

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.600
are you sure

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.120
you're not mistaken?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.760
Qingci,

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.480
I wish I were mistaken.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.880
But since this concerns royal blood,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
why not show the scar now

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.760
so we all may verify it?

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.200
Right.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.760
With Your Majesty present,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.800
this matter must be handled carefully.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.000
Later,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.280
we'll have the nanny

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.200
verify Princess's identity.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.800
No need.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.040
If you don't believe me

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.640
and insist on seeing my scar,

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.800
we'll do it right here.

00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:42.681
