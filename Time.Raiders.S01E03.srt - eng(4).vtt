00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:44.913
Xiaoge.

00:01:45.434 --> 00:01:47.393
Not bad. You're quite something.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.434
You yanked out

00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:49.753
that bug's guts in one pull.

00:01:50.113 --> 00:01:50.954
Respect.

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:52.874
So ignorant.

00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:56.112
He destroyed its central nervous system.

00:01:56.393 --> 00:01:58.594
It's paralyzed now.

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:02.674
Don't touch it, Wu Xie.

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:04.794
So it's not dead yet.

00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:07.913
Let me finish you off.

00:02:07.913 --> 00:02:08.793
Don't kill it yet.

00:02:11.274 --> 00:02:12.793
We need it to get out of this cave.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:16.714
Let me ask you something.

00:02:17.673 --> 00:02:19.673
Did that sound come from

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:20.953
the beetle

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:22.473
or the bell?

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:23.714
Third Uncle.

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:25.154
From the bell, for sure.

00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:26.673
I'm not asking you, Wu Xie.

00:02:27.154 --> 00:02:28.233
Don't interrupt.

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:30.513
And don't touch anything.

00:02:31.554 --> 00:02:32.274
You deserve it.

00:02:35.073 --> 00:02:35.434
Come on.

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:36.473
Will you tell me?

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:39.793
You know the answer.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.513
I do?

00:02:42.714 --> 00:02:44.714
Why didn't I realize that?

00:02:55.984 --> 00:02:57.274
Wu Xie, why did you smash it?

00:02:57.274 --> 00:02:57.953
I didn't.

00:02:58.073 --> 00:02:58.834
Pan Zi did.

00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:00.073
We needed it.

00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:01.434
Why did you step on it?

00:03:01.513 --> 00:03:02.314
Having fun?

00:03:02.434 --> 00:03:03.233
Absolutely.

00:03:04.473 --> 00:03:05.714
You sneak-attacked me?

00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:06.994
Something is inside.

00:03:12.034 --> 00:03:13.114
A centipede.

00:03:15.994 --> 00:03:16.793
I got it.

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:18.353
Look.

00:03:19.114 --> 00:03:20.274
This large bell contains

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:22.114
numerous smaller bells.

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:23.274
Each small bell

00:03:23.274 --> 00:03:24.913
contains hallucinogenic substances.

00:03:25.353 --> 00:03:27.114
For the potency to last this long,

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.114
it must be mineral powder.

00:03:31.473 --> 00:03:32.753
When creatures enter,

00:03:33.136 --> 00:03:34.793
the centipede crawls into the big bell,

00:03:34.793 --> 00:03:35.913
shaking the small bells.

00:03:36.594 --> 00:03:38.554
The powder disperses into the air.

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:41.594
(Creatures inhale it and hallucinate.)

00:03:43.193 --> 00:03:45.274
(Then the corpse beetles
easily kill the creatures.)

00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:47.353
After the corpse beetles feast,

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.193
the centipedes get back in

00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:51.753
to feed on the corpse beetles.

00:03:52.714 --> 00:03:54.114
It's a symbiotic system.

00:03:55.114 --> 00:03:57.233
The predecessors
built this intricate mechanism

00:03:57.594 --> 00:03:58.753
to prevent anyone from

00:03:58.753 --> 00:04:00.353
entering the cave's depths.

00:04:00.513 --> 00:04:01.513
Yeah.

00:04:02.473 --> 00:04:03.714
You're absolutely right.

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:05.753
So you knew all along.

00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:06.673
Me?

00:04:07.673 --> 00:04:08.714
What did I know?

00:04:11.394 --> 00:04:12.233
What do we do now?

00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:14.193
It's smashed. Will it still work?

00:04:14.394 --> 00:04:16.034
You said it was crucial.

00:04:18.594 --> 00:04:19.473
Third Master.

00:04:19.954 --> 00:04:21.873
This thing was so powerful when it tried

00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:23.074
to bite me.

00:04:23.274 --> 00:04:24.394
It could've drained

00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:25.993
my brain if I had been slow.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:28.233
Is it related to Ma's disappearance?

00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:31.754
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:04:33.313 --> 00:04:36.034
But the boatman and that old man

00:04:36.034 --> 00:04:38.873
(definitely wanted to strand us here)

00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:41.394
(for the beetles to kill us,)

00:04:41.993 --> 00:04:43.673
and then loot our belongings.

00:04:45.793 --> 00:04:47.634
But something went wrong today,

00:04:48.113 --> 00:04:50.034
and they got killed by these beetles.

00:04:56.394 --> 00:04:58.673
Anyway, there must be more of these.

00:05:04.154 --> 00:05:04.954
Here's the plan.

00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:07.194
Come on.

00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:09.313
Let's take a vote.

00:05:09.714 --> 00:05:10.274
Three options.

00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:15.034
First, keep moving forward.

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:17.754
Second, retreat the way we came.

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:20.194
Third, cross the mountain to exit.

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:25.394
Wu Xie.

00:05:25.634 --> 00:05:26.274
Pick one.

00:05:26.473 --> 00:05:27.553
I'm asking you now.

00:05:30.673 --> 00:05:31.514
I don't know.

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.034
What?

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:37.714
I won't choose.

00:05:39.074 --> 00:05:40.194
Young Third Master says

00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:41.473
retreat is impossible.

00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:42.313
It's blocked.

00:05:42.313 --> 00:05:43.754
We can't climb the mountain either.

00:05:43.954 --> 00:05:45.074
There's only one way out.

00:05:45.274 --> 00:05:46.394
Keep moving forward.

00:05:47.594 --> 00:05:47.954
Alright.

00:05:48.194 --> 00:05:48.714
Let's go.

00:05:53.913 --> 00:05:54.433
Impressive.

00:05:58.793 --> 00:05:59.433
Be careful.

00:05:59.754 --> 00:06:00.233
Here we go.

00:06:01.313 --> 00:06:02.913
We've packed everything we can.

00:06:05.514 --> 00:06:07.993
Tying this corpse beetle to the bow
will really get us out?

00:06:08.514 --> 00:06:10.754
We put the corpse beetle upfront

00:06:10.754 --> 00:06:13.353
to mask our presence with its smell.

00:06:14.714 --> 00:06:15.993
The path ahead is treacherous.

00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:18.274
We need it for protection.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:22.954
Since we can't go back,

00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:24.714
let's find out what place this is

00:06:24.993 --> 00:06:27.313
that deserves such deadly mechanisms.

00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:36.553
Third Uncle, ever since we entered,

00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:39.394
all the walls we've seen are granite.

00:06:39.793 --> 00:06:42.394
Even with modern technology,
it would be hard to excavate.

00:06:42.714 --> 00:06:44.394
How did ancient people manage this?

00:06:45.194 --> 00:06:47.954
They used fire-heating
and water-quenching.

00:06:48.353 --> 00:06:49.074
That means,

00:06:49.473 --> 00:06:51.233
they heated the rocks first,

00:06:51.673 --> 00:06:52.873
and then doused them

00:06:52.993 --> 00:06:54.634
with cold water to crack them,

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.233
making excavation easier.

00:06:56.594 --> 00:06:58.313
What kind of place would require

00:06:58.313 --> 00:06:59.634
such an excavation method?

00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:05.473
Third Master, ancient people would
only manage such a massive project

00:07:05.834 --> 00:07:07.074
for an emperor

00:07:07.313 --> 00:07:08.594
or for celestial worship.

00:07:08.754 --> 00:07:10.673
Maybe they built it for the deities.

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:12.754
We've been here for an hour.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:14.394
Where's the exit?

00:07:15.594 --> 00:07:17.714
This place is indeed strange.

00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:19.553
What do we do?

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:22.673
I don't believe
there's any maze we can't solve.

00:07:23.353 --> 00:07:25.113
If all else fails, we'll blast through.

00:07:25.553 --> 00:07:27.594
All your education went down the drain.

00:07:27.793 --> 00:07:28.634
"Blast through"?

00:07:29.473 --> 00:07:30.034
Be quiet.

00:07:30.954 --> 00:07:32.514
Stop.

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:34.673
Do you smell that?

00:07:36.634 --> 00:07:37.473
It reeks.

00:07:39.034 --> 00:07:41.714
There must be a pile
of rotting corpses ahead.

00:07:41.954 --> 00:07:44.154
That corpse beetle
probably came from there.

00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:47.313
If it's fleeing for its life,

00:07:49.913 --> 00:07:51.754
what's ahead will be worse.

00:07:52.154 --> 00:07:53.553
So stay alert.

00:07:56.793 --> 00:07:57.873
Take this for protection.

00:08:02.954 --> 00:08:03.553
Let's go.

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:49.154
Why are there so many animal bones here?

00:08:51.313 --> 00:08:53.634
These are drowned animals
washed down from upstream.

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:56.274
The current slows here,

00:08:56.394 --> 00:08:58.713
trapping them to feed
the corpse beetles.

00:09:10.673 --> 00:09:11.553
I think

00:09:11.553 --> 00:09:14.474
someone used corpse beetles
to keep intruders out.

00:09:16.313 --> 00:09:17.354
Is that a person?

00:09:22.713 --> 00:09:24.114
Looks like a piece of clothing.

00:09:25.673 --> 00:09:26.793
There's another one here.

00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:31.114
These caves are symmetrical,

00:09:32.394 --> 00:09:33.673
but why's this one empty?

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:00.193
Third Uncle.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.833
Third Master, look.

00:10:03.793 --> 00:10:04.553
Pan Zi.

00:10:04.593 --> 00:10:05.394
Stop.

00:10:12.874 --> 00:10:14.514
Watch out. There's a figure.

00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:15.754
What figure?

00:10:18.394 --> 00:10:20.034
Someone's playing tricks here.

00:10:20.713 --> 00:10:22.073
It's full of corpse beetles.

00:10:22.274 --> 00:10:23.073
Let me handle this.

00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:00.593
Get going.

00:11:01.514 --> 00:11:02.313
Do as he says.

00:11:05.234 --> 00:11:05.994
Flashlight off.

00:11:06.114 --> 00:11:07.394
Keep going. Don't look back.

00:11:53.154 --> 00:11:53.754
You're awake.

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:54.672
Young Third Master.

00:11:56.754 --> 00:11:57.274
Look.

00:11:57.274 --> 00:11:58.354
We're already out.

00:12:12.313 --> 00:12:13.673
What was that back there?

00:12:14.313 --> 00:12:15.833
We told you not to look back,

00:12:16.154 --> 00:12:18.193
but you had to turn around.

00:12:19.274 --> 00:12:20.833
If Xiaoge hadn't knocked you out,

00:12:20.994 --> 00:12:22.634
who knows what would've happened.

00:12:25.994 --> 00:12:26.514
That woman...

00:12:27.114 --> 00:12:28.114
What was that woman?

00:12:30.034 --> 00:12:30.913
Listen,

00:12:31.474 --> 00:12:34.234
she was that old man's wife.

00:12:34.394 --> 00:12:36.994
They got tired of all the corpse beetles

00:12:37.114 --> 00:12:39.073
and wanted fresh meat for lunch.

00:12:39.474 --> 00:12:40.994
She planned to make you into noodles

00:12:40.994 --> 00:12:42.034
and serve you up.

00:12:42.193 --> 00:12:43.114
Look at you.

00:12:44.994 --> 00:12:45.874
For real?

00:12:46.114 --> 00:12:46.953
Of course.

00:12:49.114 --> 00:12:50.193
Remember the rule.

00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:52.593
Leave cave matters buried.

00:12:53.433 --> 00:12:54.234
Wait,

00:12:55.874 --> 00:12:56.514
I just...

00:12:56.994 --> 00:12:58.193
Just what?

00:12:58.193 --> 00:12:59.713
I must have hallucinated too.

00:12:59.994 --> 00:13:01.874
I saw that woman dragging me underwater.

00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:06.953
You knew it was an illusion.

00:13:07.114 --> 00:13:08.514
So, snap out of it.

00:13:09.313 --> 00:13:10.114
I brought you

00:13:10.193 --> 00:13:13.034
to learn from the experience.

00:13:13.354 --> 00:13:17.474
When people lack confidence,
they're easily deceived.

00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:20.713
Plus, your vivid imagination

00:13:20.953 --> 00:13:23.274
could literally scare you to death.

00:13:25.394 --> 00:13:25.913
Wait.

00:13:26.953 --> 00:13:28.274
Why was I the only one?

00:13:28.514 --> 00:13:30.474
Because you're the least resolute.

00:13:30.833 --> 00:13:31.474
Enough.

00:13:31.553 --> 00:13:32.474
Forget about it.

00:13:32.593 --> 00:13:33.953
Stop bringing it up.

00:13:34.634 --> 00:13:36.634
That's a typical flaw of the Wus.

00:13:42.193 --> 00:13:43.673
Third Uncle, aren't you also a Wu?

00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:47.634
That's self-deprecating humor. Get it?

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:48.994
Your education was wasted.

00:13:49.114 --> 00:13:50.553
Can't you recognize a joke?

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:53.874
I've told you.

00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:56.154
Some experiences
shouldn't be questioned.

00:13:56.913 --> 00:13:58.634
Pretend they never happened.

00:14:01.154 --> 00:14:01.994
I can't provide you

00:14:01.994 --> 00:14:02.874
with an explanation.

00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:04.913
If you're so curious,

00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:05.953
figure it out yourself.

00:14:09.433 --> 00:14:10.154
Third Uncle,

00:14:11.114 --> 00:14:11.994
what's wrong with him?

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:14.994
He passed out from blood loss.

00:14:15.394 --> 00:14:16.234
What's the deal

00:14:16.354 --> 00:14:17.313
with this guy, anyway?

00:14:17.793 --> 00:14:19.553
He seems to know more than you do.

00:14:19.673 --> 00:14:20.793
This guy

00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:22.514
was recommended by a friend.

00:14:22.713 --> 00:14:24.274
I needed extra help.

00:14:24.634 --> 00:14:26.553
I only know his surname is Zhang.

00:14:26.874 --> 00:14:28.193
We don't ask questions.

00:14:28.514 --> 00:14:29.634
That's the rule.

00:14:30.593 --> 00:14:32.433
But my friend's reliable,

00:14:32.673 --> 00:14:35.833
so his referral should be trustworthy.

00:14:36.593 --> 00:14:37.634
Don't worry.

00:14:37.913 --> 00:14:39.754
He's probably some mysterious expert.

00:14:40.274 --> 00:14:41.754
Why are you talking so much?

00:14:41.754 --> 00:14:43.354
Your breath reeks.

00:14:43.553 --> 00:14:45.514
How much corpse beetle juice
did you drink?

00:14:46.514 --> 00:14:46.994
Da Kui.

00:14:47.154 --> 00:14:47.593
Let him

00:14:47.593 --> 00:14:48.474
rinse his mouth

00:14:48.474 --> 00:14:49.114
and shower.

00:14:49.114 --> 00:14:50.193
He stinks.

00:14:51.284 --> 00:14:52.114
Young Third Master,

00:14:52.114 --> 00:14:53.354
we're almost ashore.

00:15:25.394 --> 00:15:27.553
Mom, I already told you.

00:15:27.553 --> 00:15:29.034
Don't worry about the money.

00:15:29.193 --> 00:15:29.913
Rest well.

00:15:29.913 --> 00:15:32.114
Miss, I'll grab some snacks.

00:15:36.514 --> 00:15:36.953
Alright.

00:15:37.514 --> 00:15:37.994
Talk again.

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:39.713
Wu Xie,

00:15:40.754 --> 00:15:42.313
have some water.

00:15:45.953 --> 00:15:46.913
What's wrong?

00:15:54.073 --> 00:15:56.713
This kid has never traveled far
or seen anything.

00:15:57.114 --> 00:15:58.713
He's probably terrified.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:15:59.874
No, I'm not.

00:15:59.874 --> 00:16:01.313
- Let me check.
- Don't touch me.

00:16:01.713 --> 00:16:02.913
I'm not a child.

00:16:04.154 --> 00:16:05.154
Getting feisty now.

00:16:05.953 --> 00:16:06.793
Third Uncle,

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:09.034
why isn't Xiaoge coming down to eat?

00:16:10.034 --> 00:16:12.553
Did he lose too much blood
with that slash?

00:16:12.673 --> 00:16:14.713
Maybe he needs time to recover.

00:16:15.114 --> 00:16:15.754
He'll be fine.

00:16:16.154 --> 00:16:18.193
I ordered him stir-fried pork liver.

00:16:19.234 --> 00:16:20.874
Pork liver's here.

00:16:23.234 --> 00:16:24.553
Want anything to drink?

00:16:24.953 --> 00:16:25.874
Got any baijiu?

00:16:25.994 --> 00:16:26.514
Sure have.

00:16:26.553 --> 00:16:27.354
I'll bring

00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:28.994
our best grain liquor for you.

00:16:31.034 --> 00:16:32.313
Impressive, Miss.

00:16:32.313 --> 00:16:33.953
You've got everything here.

00:16:35.354 --> 00:16:37.433
I saw the concrete roads outside.

00:16:37.994 --> 00:16:39.553
Even the floor is concrete.

00:16:40.073 --> 00:16:41.994
How did they transport the cement here?

00:16:41.994 --> 00:16:44.274
With donkeys?

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:45.354
Pan Zi.

00:16:45.394 --> 00:16:45.754
Here.

00:16:46.193 --> 00:16:47.274
Of course not.

00:16:47.913 --> 00:16:50.474
Donkeys would take years
to haul this much cement.

00:16:50.474 --> 00:16:52.234
We've had road access for years.

00:16:52.673 --> 00:16:54.354
Even trucks could come through.

00:16:54.553 --> 00:16:57.034
But there was a landslide two years ago.

00:16:57.154 --> 00:16:58.673
The road was buried.

00:16:59.154 --> 00:17:00.713
It unearthed an ancient cauldron,

00:17:00.713 --> 00:17:02.313
some antique treasure.

00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:04.274
They shipped it away by boat.

00:17:04.954 --> 00:17:07.234
We've been rebuilding the road since,

00:17:08.034 --> 00:17:09.954
but mountain roads are hard to fix.

00:17:10.393 --> 00:17:12.954
It's been over a year,
but it's still not done.

00:17:15.153 --> 00:17:16.553
What about the river route?

00:17:16.754 --> 00:17:17.954
Don't you have a ferry?

00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:21.553
Those are decades-old stories.

00:17:21.714 --> 00:17:23.553
We haven't seen any boats for years.

00:17:23.914 --> 00:17:26.034
If anyone offers to take
the water route now,

00:17:26.034 --> 00:17:27.313
they're trying to

00:17:27.793 --> 00:17:29.553
kill you and take your money.

00:17:29.553 --> 00:17:31.120
Really? It's...

00:17:31.754 --> 00:17:32.873
You outsiders should be

00:17:32.873 --> 00:17:33.873
extra careful.

00:17:33.873 --> 00:17:35.034
These waters are cursed.

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:37.994
People drowned there and their bodies

00:17:37.994 --> 00:17:39.153
were never found.

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.113
So our elders say

00:17:41.113 --> 00:17:43.234
it might be the Mountain God

00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:44.873
swallowing them whole.

00:17:46.393 --> 00:17:46.914
Come on.

00:17:47.313 --> 00:17:48.194
Let's drink.

00:17:48.954 --> 00:17:49.274
Alright.

00:17:49.393 --> 00:17:50.113
Here.

00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:51.353
Thank you.

00:17:51.393 --> 00:17:51.793
Alright.

00:17:51.994 --> 00:17:52.833
Enjoy your trip.

00:17:52.833 --> 00:17:53.754
Enjoy the food.

00:17:53.994 --> 00:17:54.274
Okay.

00:17:54.274 --> 00:17:54.714
Thank you.

00:17:54.714 --> 00:17:55.194
Alright.

00:18:00.073 --> 00:18:00.353
Okay.

00:18:00.353 --> 00:18:01.194
Enjoy.

00:18:02.914 --> 00:18:03.353
Miss.

00:18:04.393 --> 00:18:04.833
Sit.

00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:05.954
Let me ask you something.

00:18:05.954 --> 00:18:07.833
What mountains are there around here?

00:18:07.994 --> 00:18:09.034
We want to hike.

00:18:10.073 --> 00:18:11.674
We've got plenty of mountains here,

00:18:12.034 --> 00:18:13.674
each with its own unique scenery.

00:18:13.914 --> 00:18:15.714
Let's see what you prefer.

00:18:15.954 --> 00:18:17.714
We're into extreme rock climbing.

00:18:17.714 --> 00:18:19.914
So we're looking for exciting spots.

00:18:20.353 --> 00:18:21.313
Where is that mountain

00:18:21.313 --> 00:18:23.274
with the giant ancient cauldron?

00:18:23.754 --> 00:18:26.474
Mount Shending? You can't go there.

00:18:26.994 --> 00:18:27.353
Come on.

00:18:27.754 --> 00:18:28.194
Take a sip.

00:18:28.194 --> 00:18:29.552
Come on. Cheers.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.313
Why can't we go there?

00:18:37.113 --> 00:18:38.593
My grandpa says that the mountain

00:18:38.593 --> 00:18:40.633
used to be where immortals lived.

00:18:40.873 --> 00:18:42.474
It's full of their treasures.

00:18:42.593 --> 00:18:44.113
No one should go there.

00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:47.754
Actually, not only did a cauldron emerge

00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:49.034
after that landslide.

00:18:49.793 --> 00:18:52.474
Guess what else they found.

00:18:53.514 --> 00:18:54.514
What was it?

00:18:55.113 --> 00:18:56.593
The treasures of the immortal?

00:18:57.234 --> 00:18:58.474
Would've been removed already

00:18:58.474 --> 00:18:59.674
if that were the case.

00:19:00.434 --> 00:19:01.553
Here's the secret.

00:19:01.754 --> 00:19:03.833
Don't tell anyone.

00:19:04.873 --> 00:19:07.234
They dug out
over a hundred turtle shells.

00:19:07.353 --> 00:19:08.034
Turtle shells?

00:19:09.393 --> 00:19:10.194
Isn't that spooky?

00:19:10.194 --> 00:19:11.994
Just shells, no bodies?

00:19:12.313 --> 00:19:13.353
Yeah.

00:19:14.034 --> 00:19:15.393
My grandpa says those shells

00:19:15.393 --> 00:19:17.474
belonged to people
who coveted the treasures.

00:19:17.914 --> 00:19:20.153
The immortals turned them into turtles,

00:19:20.434 --> 00:19:22.434
and then took away their bodies,

00:19:22.434 --> 00:19:23.954
leaving only the shells behind.

00:19:24.833 --> 00:19:26.873
Why do I feel a bit insulted?

00:19:31.873 --> 00:19:32.793
Here's the thing.

00:19:33.593 --> 00:19:34.313
We're looking

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:35.593
for someone.

00:19:36.194 --> 00:19:38.194
You know, we explore mountains.

00:19:38.793 --> 00:19:39.994
A few years back,

00:19:39.994 --> 00:19:41.434
one of our team members

00:19:41.434 --> 00:19:42.593
went missing here.

00:19:42.994 --> 00:19:44.034
We never found him.

00:19:44.553 --> 00:19:46.313
Have you seen this person?

00:19:50.274 --> 00:19:51.553
I remember him.

00:19:53.313 --> 00:19:55.833
That was years ago.

00:19:56.593 --> 00:19:57.954
He had a few drinks

00:19:58.553 --> 00:19:59.833
to muster some courage.

00:20:00.153 --> 00:20:01.914
He downed an entire bottle of baijiu.

00:20:02.313 --> 00:20:04.873
He went to the mountain
where the deities resided.

00:20:05.714 --> 00:20:07.873
And he never came back.

00:20:14.674 --> 00:20:16.474
Look how scared you are.

00:20:18.073 --> 00:20:18.994
I'm easily scared.

00:20:20.754 --> 00:20:22.593
I got carried away chatting with you.

00:20:22.873 --> 00:20:23.474
Enjoy the food

00:20:23.474 --> 00:20:24.313
and the drinks.

00:20:24.593 --> 00:20:25.714
Let me bring your dishes.

00:20:25.714 --> 00:20:26.434
Come on.

00:20:26.714 --> 00:20:27.754
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:20:27.754 --> 00:20:28.553
Cheers.

00:20:28.553 --> 00:20:30.672
- Bottoms up.
- I'll bring your dishes.

00:20:30.672 --> 00:20:32.304
- Enjoy your trip.
- Cheers.

00:20:34.674 --> 00:20:35.728
- Thank you, Miss.
- Alright.

00:20:41.674 --> 00:20:42.593
Seems like

00:20:42.593 --> 00:20:43.754
we came to the right place.

00:20:43.754 --> 00:20:44.954
This trip wasn't wasted.

00:20:45.474 --> 00:20:46.234
Right?

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:49.353
Dig in.

00:20:52.994 --> 00:20:53.593
Wu Xie.

00:20:53.593 --> 00:20:54.434
Will you take

00:20:54.434 --> 00:20:56.393
the pork liver up to Xiaoge?

00:20:56.994 --> 00:20:57.994
I'll pack a few pieces.

00:20:57.994 --> 00:20:58.954
I was thinking that.

00:20:59.674 --> 00:21:01.034
That won't be enough.

00:21:02.153 --> 00:21:02.954
Pack some more.

00:21:02.954 --> 00:21:03.754
That's enough.

00:21:03.754 --> 00:21:04.434
He's eating alone

00:21:04.434 --> 00:21:05.954
while four of us share this.

00:21:06.034 --> 00:21:07.153
Don't be so stingy.

00:21:07.153 --> 00:21:08.954
Does a big guy like you
need to replenish?

00:21:08.954 --> 00:21:10.914
Third Master, that beetle in the cave

00:21:11.153 --> 00:21:12.113
was huge.

00:21:12.113 --> 00:21:13.754
I was terrified. I need replenishment.

00:21:13.754 --> 00:21:15.073
That's enough.

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:27.873
You came for food
and asked for tons of information.

00:21:28.593 --> 00:21:30.353
Busy guy, huh?

00:21:31.593 --> 00:21:33.393
Do you see many busy guys coming here?

00:21:34.153 --> 00:21:35.034
Not exactly.

00:21:35.274 --> 00:21:36.954
About 40 or 50 a year.

00:21:37.833 --> 00:21:38.754
Fewer this year.

00:21:38.754 --> 00:21:39.994
The weather's been bad.

00:21:41.553 --> 00:21:42.914
If you're in this together

00:21:42.914 --> 00:21:44.553
with those people in the cave,

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:45.313
stop waiting.

00:21:45.434 --> 00:21:47.674
At least one of them isn't coming back.

00:21:48.353 --> 00:21:49.393
Change your profession.

00:21:49.674 --> 00:21:51.393
Focus on running this place.

00:21:53.194 --> 00:21:55.353
Honestly, I'm here to find someone.

00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:57.474
Tell me what you know

00:21:57.474 --> 00:21:59.034
and I'll guarantee your safety.

00:21:59.313 --> 00:22:01.954
Otherwise, I'll expose you.

00:22:04.914 --> 00:22:06.153
You're that certain?

00:22:06.793 --> 00:22:08.393
Stop slandering me.

00:22:08.514 --> 00:22:09.714
I'm not buying it.

00:22:11.994 --> 00:22:13.393
Just point the way.

00:22:20.954 --> 00:22:22.393
Jia-Shan-Gen configuration.

00:22:22.914 --> 00:22:24.474
Follow the compass forward.

00:22:24.873 --> 00:22:27.194
That's where Ma went years ago.

00:22:27.714 --> 00:22:29.034
We didn't touch him.

00:22:31.914 --> 00:22:32.994
Thanks.

00:22:37.434 --> 00:22:39.553
You carry too many burdens.

00:22:44.954 --> 00:22:47.593
Mount Shending doesn't fancy
those burdened with thoughts.

00:22:48.393 --> 00:22:49.793
You'll die there.

00:22:59.754 --> 00:23:00.793
(Grandpa,)

00:23:01.073 --> 00:23:02.434
(I'm finally experiencing)

00:23:02.434 --> 00:23:04.914
(those bizarre events
from your notebooks.)

00:23:06.353 --> 00:23:07.674
(Did I make the right choice?)

00:23:08.234 --> 00:23:11.593
(Have I truly seized
my life's turning point?)

00:24:13.674 --> 00:24:14.553
Third Uncle.

00:24:15.914 --> 00:24:16.714
There.

00:24:17.833 --> 00:24:19.873
It's that old man
who took us to the cave.

00:24:52.994 --> 00:24:54.274
Come here.

00:24:54.674 --> 00:24:55.954
You think you can run?

00:24:57.754 --> 00:24:58.833
Let's go to the police.

00:24:59.674 --> 00:25:01.034
You scheming murderer.

00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:03.833
No.

00:25:38.393 --> 00:25:39.313
Gentlemen.

00:25:39.474 --> 00:25:40.793
Please spare me.

00:25:42.553 --> 00:25:44.194
I had no other choice.

00:25:44.994 --> 00:25:46.674
I shouldn't have tricked you.

00:25:46.873 --> 00:25:48.234
I never imagined

00:25:48.234 --> 00:25:49.873
you were such experts.

00:25:50.514 --> 00:25:51.873
Please forgive my ignorance.

00:25:51.954 --> 00:25:52.994
Please forgive me.

00:25:53.274 --> 00:25:54.153
Please forgive me.

00:25:54.153 --> 00:25:55.073
Listen.

00:25:55.514 --> 00:25:57.793
Old man, if we were ordinary people,

00:25:58.434 --> 00:25:59.514
we'd be dead now.

00:25:59.514 --> 00:26:00.560
- Right?
- No.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.994
- How many have you killed?
- I've never killed anyone.

00:26:03.113 --> 00:26:03.568
Never?

00:26:03.568 --> 00:26:04.793
I swear I've never done that.

00:26:04.914 --> 00:26:05.936
You guys are the first.

00:26:07.793 --> 00:26:09.153
We're so lucky?

00:26:09.553 --> 00:26:11.312
- No.
- Tell me. Old man.

00:26:11.728 --> 00:26:13.833
How did you disappear in that cave?

00:26:16.153 --> 00:26:17.034
If I confess,

00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:19.073
will you spare me?

00:26:19.274 --> 00:26:20.274
Speak.

00:26:20.434 --> 00:26:21.754
Alright, I'll tell you.

00:26:23.873 --> 00:26:24.873
That cave

00:26:25.073 --> 00:26:26.833
may look like a straight tunnel,

00:26:27.034 --> 00:26:28.833
but there are cavities on the ceiling.

00:26:31.393 --> 00:26:33.434
You can't easily spot them.

00:26:33.954 --> 00:26:34.793
When

00:26:35.034 --> 00:26:36.674
you weren't looking,

00:26:36.793 --> 00:26:38.833
I hid in one of the cavities.

00:26:39.914 --> 00:26:41.593
After your boat left,

00:26:41.954 --> 00:26:42.873
I whistled

00:26:43.073 --> 00:26:44.674
and Lv Dandan towed

00:26:44.833 --> 00:26:45.954
a wooden barrel over.

00:26:45.954 --> 00:26:47.313
Usually, we'd take

00:26:47.353 --> 00:26:48.873
your belongings home

00:26:49.153 --> 00:26:50.353
and split the loot.

00:26:50.633 --> 00:26:51.073
You know.

00:26:51.434 --> 00:26:53.313
I get a tiny share of it.

00:26:54.514 --> 00:26:56.393
How loyal of you.

00:26:56.474 --> 00:26:57.714
Such a loyal friend.

00:26:57.714 --> 00:26:58.754
A tiny share?

00:26:58.754 --> 00:27:00.674
You left your partner
to die in the cave.

00:27:02.113 --> 00:27:03.353
You mean Lu Lao'er?

00:27:03.514 --> 00:27:04.393
No.

00:27:04.593 --> 00:27:06.674
You saw him hanging in the cave,

00:27:06.954 --> 00:27:07.954
covered in blood, huh?

00:27:08.194 --> 00:27:09.393
That was fake.

00:27:09.873 --> 00:27:11.153
That was a dummy.

00:27:11.153 --> 00:27:12.274
He's got two more at home.

00:27:12.274 --> 00:27:13.514
You made this up?

00:27:15.274 --> 00:27:16.113
Yang.

00:27:16.274 --> 00:27:18.234
Is that woman in white your wife?

00:27:18.434 --> 00:27:19.474
The woman in white.

00:27:19.474 --> 00:27:20.434
Is she your wife?

00:27:21.793 --> 00:27:22.313
Is she?

00:27:22.313 --> 00:27:23.553
No, no.

00:27:23.593 --> 00:27:25.073
It's a dummy made by Lu Lao'er,

00:27:25.073 --> 00:27:26.514
filled with rotten flesh.

00:27:26.873 --> 00:27:29.313
The flesh attracts corpse beetles,

00:27:29.793 --> 00:27:31.113
which makes the dummy move

00:27:31.633 --> 00:27:32.714
to scare people.

00:27:35.353 --> 00:27:36.313
Please.

00:27:37.714 --> 00:27:38.674
Let me go.

00:27:44.553 --> 00:27:45.833
Do you live there?

00:27:46.393 --> 00:27:47.274
Yeah.

00:27:47.714 --> 00:27:48.553
I live there.

00:27:48.553 --> 00:27:49.040
No fields.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:49.552
No land.

00:27:49.552 --> 00:27:50.194
No children.

00:27:50.514 --> 00:27:51.353
No family or friends.

00:27:51.514 --> 00:27:52.633
Just waiting to die here.

00:27:53.073 --> 00:27:53.914
Waiting to die?

00:27:55.234 --> 00:27:55.994
Then you must

00:27:57.073 --> 00:27:57.793
know this area

00:27:58.873 --> 00:28:00.393
pretty well, huh?

00:28:02.313 --> 00:28:03.194
Absolutely.

00:28:06.754 --> 00:28:07.833
Jia-Shan-Gen configuration.

00:28:08.113 --> 00:28:09.474
The magnetic field is chaotic.

00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:11.073
Compasses don't work.

00:28:11.073 --> 00:28:12.553
Guide us there.

00:28:12.714 --> 00:28:13.113
Guide?

00:28:13.313 --> 00:28:14.113
Sure.

00:28:15.553 --> 00:28:16.353
Alright?

00:28:20.194 --> 00:28:21.474
Check this out.

00:28:25.393 --> 00:28:25.914
Here.

00:28:27.194 --> 00:28:29.793
What does the fox face stand for?

00:28:36.873 --> 00:28:37.754
Mount Shending.

00:28:38.313 --> 00:28:39.474
Mount Shending?

00:28:40.714 --> 00:28:41.914
Mount Shending.

00:28:43.714 --> 00:28:44.754
Lead the way.

00:28:47.633 --> 00:28:48.714
Not this place.

00:28:48.714 --> 00:28:50.234
I've never been there.

00:28:50.994 --> 00:28:52.873
But you know it's Mount Shending?

00:28:54.274 --> 00:28:55.553
I've been there.

00:28:56.833 --> 00:28:58.153
There was a landslide.

00:28:58.553 --> 00:28:59.914
Over a hundred turtle shells.

00:29:00.153 --> 00:29:01.234
Legend says the turtles

00:29:01.234 --> 00:29:03.313
were eaten by monsters
serving the deities.

00:29:03.514 --> 00:29:05.274
Those monsters guard the mountain.

00:29:05.274 --> 00:29:06.113
We can't go there.

00:29:06.113 --> 00:29:08.113
No one who entered ever survived.

00:29:08.313 --> 00:29:09.194
No one came out.

00:29:09.313 --> 00:29:10.194
They all disappeared.

00:29:10.313 --> 00:29:11.914
I had a friend who was

00:29:11.952 --> 00:29:13.393
even more skilled than Lu Lao'er.

00:29:13.474 --> 00:29:14.393
He never made it out.

00:29:14.474 --> 00:29:15.873
I'd rather die than go there.

00:29:16.194 --> 00:29:17.593
I'd rather die.

00:29:17.674 --> 00:29:18.633
So you're saying,

00:29:19.714 --> 00:29:20.914
Mount Shending

00:29:21.313 --> 00:29:24.714
is creepier than the wet cave.

00:29:24.994 --> 00:29:26.474
Yeah.

00:29:26.914 --> 00:29:27.593
Yeah.

00:29:28.514 --> 00:29:30.274
Are we still going there?

00:29:31.954 --> 00:29:33.514
No, no.

00:29:34.674 --> 00:29:35.514
No?

00:29:35.514 --> 00:29:36.754
He says we're not going.

00:29:36.754 --> 00:29:38.914
You think we'll listen to you?

00:29:38.914 --> 00:29:39.792
No?

00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:42.353
You think your word is final?

00:31:42.954 --> 00:31:43.754
Come here.

00:31:44.034 --> 00:31:45.113
Dandan!

00:31:45.994 --> 00:31:46.674
Monsters.

00:31:47.194 --> 00:31:48.474
- Dandan sensed monsters.
- Go where?

00:31:48.474 --> 00:31:48.912
Grab him.

00:31:48.912 --> 00:31:49.434
- Monsters.
- Shut up.

00:31:49.434 --> 00:31:50.353
Run.

00:31:51.153 --> 00:31:52.073
- I need Lv Dandan.
- Pan Zi.

00:31:52.073 --> 00:31:52.593
Stop it.

00:31:52.754 --> 00:31:53.553
- Go.
- Look.

00:31:53.553 --> 00:31:54.353
Dandan.

00:31:54.714 --> 00:31:55.514
Dandan.

00:31:55.514 --> 00:31:56.873
There's a campsite ahead.

00:31:57.434 --> 00:31:58.633
Is someone there or not?

00:31:59.553 --> 00:32:00.914
Let me check it out.

00:34:53.593 --> 00:34:56.193
Third Master, this campsite looks

00:34:56.193 --> 00:34:57.713
like it's been abandoned for years.

00:34:57.914 --> 00:34:59.233
Based on the timeline,

00:34:59.394 --> 00:35:01.593
it lines up with Ma's disappearance.

00:35:01.673 --> 00:35:03.193
Could this be Ma's team?

00:35:03.633 --> 00:35:04.713
Most likely.

00:35:04.713 --> 00:35:06.514
Something must've happened to them.

00:35:12.874 --> 00:35:14.193
But this is weird.

00:35:14.713 --> 00:35:15.633
What is it?

00:35:16.593 --> 00:35:19.193
A team this size would normally

00:35:19.193 --> 00:35:21.073
leave someone to guard the camp.

00:35:21.394 --> 00:35:23.434
Even if Ma's group had an accident,

00:35:23.794 --> 00:35:25.233
where's the guard?

00:35:25.514 --> 00:35:27.073
Maybe they all fled.

00:35:27.273 --> 00:35:29.394
But they left the equipment?

00:35:29.394 --> 00:35:31.434
These are worth a lifetime's pay.

00:35:33.354 --> 00:35:35.514
Yeah, this is downright eerie.

00:35:43.713 --> 00:35:45.874
Wait, something's wrong with this place.

00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:06.713
Have some water.

00:36:07.874 --> 00:36:09.034
Stay hydrated.

00:36:20.034 --> 00:36:20.834
I'm done.

00:36:21.314 --> 00:36:23.088
- What's wrong? Sit!
- I must find Lv Dandan.

00:36:23.394 --> 00:36:24.434
It's never been here.

00:36:24.434 --> 00:36:26.073
Your dog even helped you commit crimes.

00:36:26.073 --> 00:36:27.193
You think it'll get lost?

00:36:27.834 --> 00:36:29.073
We still haven't

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:30.314
settled the score.

00:36:30.314 --> 00:36:32.073
You must take us where we want to go.

00:36:35.474 --> 00:36:37.714
Third Master, you're right.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.273
They left all their gear
and personal belongings behind.

00:36:41.553 --> 00:36:43.593
Yeah, look at those cups.

00:36:45.834 --> 00:36:47.113
Look how they're placed.

00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:49.633
I bet they just made tea

00:36:49.994 --> 00:36:51.153
and didn't even take a sip.

00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:53.633
Also, check the equipment.

00:36:58.753 --> 00:37:00.593
Third Master, something's off.

00:37:01.593 --> 00:37:03.753
All their devices are switched

00:37:03.753 --> 00:37:04.914
to the "on" position.

00:37:05.113 --> 00:37:06.314
This is weird.

00:37:07.673 --> 00:37:08.633
Yeah.

00:37:10.034 --> 00:37:11.354
This place is weird.

00:37:12.314 --> 00:37:14.753
Everything here looks like

00:37:15.354 --> 00:37:16.713
they just set up the camp

00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:17.954
and the equipment.

00:37:18.354 --> 00:37:19.434
Then suddenly,

00:37:20.034 --> 00:37:21.874
they all vanished.

00:37:22.593 --> 00:37:23.713
Vanished?

00:38:30.645 --> 00:38:33.508
