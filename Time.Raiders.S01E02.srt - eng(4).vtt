00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:11.162
(I've finally embarked on the journey.)

00:02:12.688 --> 00:02:13.643
(In Grandpa's notes,)

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:15.562
(those fascinating stories)

00:02:16.144 --> 00:02:17.243
(made me fantasize)

00:02:17.243 --> 00:02:18.882
(about this journey.)

00:02:20.016 --> 00:02:22.562
(I wonder if I will encounter)

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.456
(that many bizarre things
as Grandpa did.)

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.762
(But I have a strong premonition)

00:02:39.344 --> 00:02:42.523
(that my life
is now beginning a new chapter)

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:44.842
(with this journey.)

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.803
(I want to record)

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.368
(what I see and feel in this journey)

00:02:52.368 --> 00:02:53.683
(like Grandpa did.)

00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:58.562
(Will it be an interesting story?)

00:03:43.363 --> 00:03:44.336
Third Uncle.

00:03:46.602 --> 00:03:48.162
Who is that guy?

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:50.442
Why is he acting like a mute?

00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:51.882
Don't underestimate him.

00:03:52.203 --> 00:03:53.523
He's quite agile.

00:03:54.096 --> 00:03:55.888
Can he really help at this young age?

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.923
In this world,

00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:00.523
some people like to brag,

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:02.282
some keep a low profile,

00:04:03.024 --> 00:04:05.520
and some are clueless
about who they are.

00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:07.683
What kind of person are you?

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.642
Wait, Third Uncle.

00:04:34.544 --> 00:04:36.723
Hi, I'm Wu Xie.

00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:54.768
This way, everyone.

00:04:54.768 --> 00:04:57.442
Yang, are you a full-time guide here?

00:04:57.968 --> 00:04:59.123
People visit here often?

00:04:59.472 --> 00:05:00.603
Yes.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.680
Young people nowadays

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.202
love exploring mountains.

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:03.683
Is that so?

00:05:03.824 --> 00:05:04.336
We're here.

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:05.243
Already?

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:05.840
Yes.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.603
This is the final stretch.

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:11.843
No vehicles or roads ahead.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.040
We need to take a boat

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.202
to reach the cave you mentioned.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.762
Where's the boat?

00:05:20.272 --> 00:05:21.168
Just wait.

00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:25.123
Lv Dandan!

00:05:27.283 --> 00:05:28.803
The boatman's name is Lv Dandan?

00:05:28.803 --> 00:05:30.322
What a peculiar name.

00:05:31.683 --> 00:05:32.843
Dandan!

00:05:38.283 --> 00:05:39.632
Why is there a dog?

00:05:39.632 --> 00:05:41.723
Are we supposed to ride the dog?

00:05:41.723 --> 00:05:43.202
How could we ride a dog?

00:05:43.202 --> 00:05:45.840
The dog is our messenger.

00:05:49.483 --> 00:05:50.562
What?

00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:53.322
Lv Dandan.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.522
The dog told me

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:00.642
it's still early.

00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:02.243
The boatman isn't ready yet.

00:06:02.442 --> 00:06:03.562
Let's rest for a while.

00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:05.243
Amazing!

00:06:05.243 --> 00:06:06.800
You understand dog language?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.082
Okay.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.968
I think it's around two o'clock already.

00:06:13.968 --> 00:06:15.792
That guy is still not ready to work yet?

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.072
Can he be that slack off?

00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:19.803
He's the only boatman here.

00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:21.360
He works

00:06:21.683 --> 00:06:23.123
whenever he wants to.

00:06:23.536 --> 00:06:24.923
Even the village chief

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:27.216
can't do anything about him.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.880
Get someone else then.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.096
Someone more diligent.

00:06:30.096 --> 00:06:31.312
We'd love to,

00:06:31.696 --> 00:06:33.163
but you outsiders don't know.

00:06:33.163 --> 00:06:34.522
The Mountain God

00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:36.043
only likes him.

00:06:36.043 --> 00:06:38.064
Others go there and never return.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.472
Only he can

00:06:39.472 --> 00:06:40.720
go in and out safely.

00:06:41.008 --> 00:06:41.936
It's eerie.

00:06:42.448 --> 00:06:44.522
How can such a strange thing happen?

00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:46.992
Did others who enter the cave

00:06:46.992 --> 00:06:47.920
get devoured?

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.402
That cave devours people?

00:06:49.744 --> 00:06:50.832
Elders in the village

00:06:50.832 --> 00:06:52.816
say a snake monster lives inside,

00:06:53.456 --> 00:06:54.832
and the boatman's ancestors

00:06:54.832 --> 00:06:56.723
once saved the snake monster's life,

00:06:56.723 --> 00:06:58.082
so he can enter the cave safely.

00:06:58.082 --> 00:06:58.762
A snake monster?

00:06:58.762 --> 00:06:59.472
Eerie.

00:06:59.568 --> 00:07:00.562
A rumor, I guess.

00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:02.683
Anyway, young explorers who've entered

00:07:03.152 --> 00:07:04.442
never made it back.

00:07:07.664 --> 00:07:09.776
The routes in the cave must be complex,

00:07:09.776 --> 00:07:11.056
trapping them forever.

00:07:11.184 --> 00:07:12.496
Where were

00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:14.128
the boatman's ancestors from,

00:07:14.128 --> 00:07:15.163
Yang?

00:07:15.163 --> 00:07:16.683
I don't know.

00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:18.762
That's long, long ago!

00:07:19.363 --> 00:07:20.442
I don't know.

00:07:20.848 --> 00:07:22.363
Why do you smell so bad?

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:27.760
Haven't you taken a bath?

00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:29.562
Didn't you just come out of the river?

00:07:33.243 --> 00:07:34.123
Lv Dandan.

00:07:34.283 --> 00:07:34.923
Come here.

00:07:34.923 --> 00:07:36.082
This dog is off.

00:07:36.843 --> 00:07:37.803
Go...

00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:39.123
Go fetch the boat.

00:07:47.024 --> 00:07:47.632
What?

00:07:47.632 --> 00:07:48.522
Third Master.

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:50.683
The dog smells wrong.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.712
Right. It's stinky.

00:07:54.096 --> 00:07:55.536
This dog eats bat dung.

00:07:57.776 --> 00:07:59.163
The old man is suspicious too.

00:07:59.163 --> 00:08:00.642
He's been stalling.

00:08:01.264 --> 00:08:03.088
I think he's waiting for something.

00:08:04.272 --> 00:08:06.163
Probably waiting for the sun to set.

00:08:06.384 --> 00:08:08.656
That boatman eats bat dung too.

00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:10.640
Maybe people who eat bat dung

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.762
can't handle summer heat,

00:08:13.936 --> 00:08:16.243
and have to come out at cooler times.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.448
If I'm right,

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:20.816
that is

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.512
a wet cave.

00:08:37.872 --> 00:08:38.672
Third Uncle.

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:44.976
Third Uncle.

00:08:45.776 --> 00:08:47.376
What exactly is a wet cave?

00:08:51.952 --> 00:08:53.008
Not sure.

00:08:53.603 --> 00:08:55.282
But on a past expedition,

00:08:55.443 --> 00:08:57.363
I entered a cave

00:08:57.522 --> 00:08:59.042
that was used

00:08:59.216 --> 00:09:01.424
by Japanese to bury massacre victims.

00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:04.272
It was full of corpses.

00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:06.323
All we did is

00:09:06.323 --> 00:09:10.522
to tie poultry and dogs
to the bamboo raft.

00:09:11.248 --> 00:09:12.528
Then

00:09:12.528 --> 00:09:13.882
mount a camera on it.

00:09:14.802 --> 00:09:15.792
Slowly

00:09:15.792 --> 00:09:16.944
send the raft

00:09:16.944 --> 00:09:19.152
into the cave.

00:09:24.368 --> 00:09:26.608
(We used long cables.)

00:09:27.344 --> 00:09:29.296
(But when cables ran out,)

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.402
(the raft still didn't come out.)

00:09:32.592 --> 00:09:34.256
(It drifted away somewhere.)

00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:37.264
(We tried pulling it back.)

00:09:38.128 --> 00:09:39.312
(But after a few pulls,)

00:09:40.912 --> 00:09:42.563
(the raft flipped suddenly.)

00:09:45.296 --> 00:09:46.802
(At the end of the video,)

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.688
(there occurred half a creepy face)

00:09:49.296 --> 00:09:50.736
(on the screen.)

00:09:53.488 --> 00:09:54.563
What was

00:09:54.563 --> 00:09:55.802
that exactly?

00:09:57.762 --> 00:09:58.576
Later, I discovered

00:09:58.576 --> 00:10:00.203
it was just a monkey.

00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:04.203
Know how ancient people handled it?

00:10:05.642 --> 00:10:07.762
They'd feed people

00:10:07.762 --> 00:10:09.843
bat dung daily

00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:11.882
for three to six months.

00:10:13.802 --> 00:10:16.002
What's bat dung exactly?

00:10:16.963 --> 00:10:18.203
Just as its name implies.

00:10:21.603 --> 00:10:23.963
Anyway, eating bat dung

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:25.936
can make people

00:10:25.936 --> 00:10:28.363
smell like bats.

00:10:29.008 --> 00:10:30.384
Then they'd enter.

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:34.282
Even ghosts couldn't tell

00:10:34.282 --> 00:10:36.203
if they are human or ghosts.

00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:39.152
So, only boatmen

00:10:40.002 --> 00:10:41.200
can enter the cave

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.843
because they eat bat dung.

00:10:43.408 --> 00:10:45.042
He's eaten it,

00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:47.216
but we haven't.

00:10:48.762 --> 00:10:50.384
It's superstition,

00:10:50.896 --> 00:10:53.328
but we still need be cautious.

00:10:53.808 --> 00:10:55.952
This cave is probably dangerous.

00:11:00.144 --> 00:11:01.162
Scared?

00:11:02.448 --> 00:11:03.568
Not really.

00:11:03.888 --> 00:11:04.976
No.

00:11:07.056 --> 00:11:08.642
Admit it if you're scared.

00:11:09.083 --> 00:11:10.243
You can stay.

00:11:12.048 --> 00:11:12.944
I'm fine.

00:11:14.992 --> 00:11:16.042
Young Third Master.

00:11:23.504 --> 00:11:25.008
Are you dumb?

00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:29.843
Eating bat dung is no big deal.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.843
Third Master was fooling you.

00:11:33.232 --> 00:11:35.203
Is eating bat dung common?

00:11:39.402 --> 00:11:41.443
Let me tell you something.

00:11:42.762 --> 00:11:43.723
Do you know

00:11:44.882 --> 00:11:46.723
there's a prison

00:11:47.363 --> 00:11:48.522
in Mobei Manledan?

00:11:49.682 --> 00:11:51.282
If the inmates

00:11:51.282 --> 00:11:52.882
want to escape,

00:11:52.882 --> 00:11:54.522
they have to do so

00:11:54.762 --> 00:11:56.363
as three people.

00:11:56.642 --> 00:11:57.762
Do you know why?

00:11:57.762 --> 00:11:58.672
Why?

00:12:00.144 --> 00:12:02.762
The prison is built deep

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:05.402
(in a snow mountain.)

00:12:07.083 --> 00:12:08.203
Nonsense.

00:12:08.882 --> 00:12:10.512
Mobei has no snow mountains!

00:12:10.512 --> 00:12:13.200
I can tell you didn't
learn geography well.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.736
Mobei's highest peak

00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:17.243
is with an altitude of 5,881 meters.

00:12:17.648 --> 00:12:18.320
Right.

00:12:18.544 --> 00:12:19.696
Three people escape,

00:12:20.752 --> 00:12:21.872
(with no equipment)

00:12:22.288 --> 00:12:23.536
(or food.)

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.608
If one of them collapses...

00:12:26.608 --> 00:12:27.243
Tell me,

00:12:27.243 --> 00:12:28.624
what should the other two do?

00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:33.872
Eat him.

00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:35.408
If they don't, they'll die.

00:12:35.843 --> 00:12:36.723
Right?

00:12:36.752 --> 00:12:38.162
After it, they can keep going

00:12:38.352 --> 00:12:40.443
until another one collapses.

00:12:40.522 --> 00:12:41.762
Then the last person eats him.

00:12:43.723 --> 00:12:44.682
(In the end,)

00:12:44.843 --> 00:12:47.363
only one person can survive.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.040
I wonder how you heard

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.642
such a disgusting story.

00:12:54.642 --> 00:12:56.203
It's not disgusting at all.

00:12:56.483 --> 00:12:58.083
Because I

00:12:59.402 --> 00:13:01.402
was the one who survived.

00:13:02.802 --> 00:13:04.443
Really?

00:13:05.392 --> 00:13:06.483
It's true.

00:13:12.304 --> 00:13:13.136
Pan Zi.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.443
How many more times

00:13:15.802 --> 00:13:17.203
would you tell this story?

00:13:17.328 --> 00:13:19.216
You tell the same old story every time.

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:22.256
But your version today
differs a bit from what I heard

00:13:22.352 --> 00:13:23.728
before.

00:13:24.048 --> 00:13:25.904
I think you have changed.

00:13:27.632 --> 00:13:28.240
Third Master.

00:13:28.464 --> 00:13:29.648
What's different?

00:13:30.384 --> 00:13:31.522
Have I changed?

00:13:32.048 --> 00:13:32.912
Wait.

00:14:10.352 --> 00:14:11.312
The boat is here.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:12.784
Come on.

00:14:12.784 --> 00:14:13.744
Time to board the boat.

00:14:45.584 --> 00:14:47.376
Remember the rules.

00:14:48.048 --> 00:14:48.944
In the cave,

00:14:48.944 --> 00:14:50.483
keep your voices low.

00:14:50.483 --> 00:14:51.536
Don't look into the water

00:14:51.888 --> 00:14:54.363
and never speak ill of the Mountain God.

00:14:56.208 --> 00:14:58.963
How long will it take to pass through?

00:14:58.963 --> 00:15:00.243
Five minutes at best.

00:15:00.528 --> 00:15:02.123
The current is flowing fast,

00:15:02.123 --> 00:15:03.042
so it goes quickly.

00:15:04.048 --> 00:15:05.168
What about at worst?

00:15:05.584 --> 00:15:06.922
The water

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:09.200
flows downstream sometimes,

00:15:09.563 --> 00:15:11.402
so when we enter,

00:15:11.402 --> 00:15:12.802
we are going against the current.

00:15:13.072 --> 00:15:14.192
That takes longer,

00:15:14.512 --> 00:15:15.882
about 15 minutes.

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:17.424
There are many bends inside.

00:15:17.424 --> 00:15:18.282
It's dangerous.

00:15:18.483 --> 00:15:19.856
And it's complete dark inside,

00:15:19.856 --> 00:15:21.168
so we won't see a thing.

00:15:21.424 --> 00:15:22.843
Stay alert.

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:25.162
But for him,

00:15:25.162 --> 00:15:26.443
with over a decade's experience,

00:15:26.563 --> 00:15:28.642
he relies on his ears.

00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:31.443
Anyway,

00:15:31.443 --> 00:15:32.963
follow my rules exactly.

00:15:36.176 --> 00:15:38.002
Can we use flashlights?

00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:40.688
It's okay.

00:15:41.008 --> 00:15:42.576
Never shine them on the water,

00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:43.843
or you'll regret it.

00:15:43.984 --> 00:15:44.816
Why?

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.512
Water ghosts?

00:15:47.762 --> 00:15:49.162
That's nothing.

00:15:49.162 --> 00:15:51.083
What's in there is unimaginable.

00:15:51.203 --> 00:15:52.402
If you're brave enough,

00:15:52.402 --> 00:15:53.360
take a look yourself.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.576
I don't know either.

00:15:54.576 --> 00:15:55.632
If you're lucky,

00:15:55.632 --> 00:15:57.264
you'll just see dark water.

00:15:57.264 --> 00:15:58.608
If unlucky,

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:01.963
you'll get scared!

00:16:02.363 --> 00:16:03.443
Have you seen them?

00:16:03.824 --> 00:16:04.656
Me?

00:16:04.976 --> 00:16:06.128
Never.

00:16:11.056 --> 00:16:11.792
Third Master.

00:16:12.816 --> 00:16:14.288
Can we trust this guy?

00:16:14.384 --> 00:16:16.592
He's full of spooky tales.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.682
They're all suspicious.

00:16:19.216 --> 00:16:20.603
Once we enter,

00:16:20.603 --> 00:16:22.203
they might do unexpected things.

00:16:22.512 --> 00:16:23.563
Stay alert.

00:17:09.803 --> 00:17:11.523
This cave is so narrow.

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:13.323
This is spacious.

00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:14.256
There's a stretch ahead

00:17:14.288 --> 00:17:15.563
even lower than here.

00:17:15.563 --> 00:17:16.592
This is spacious?

00:17:16.912 --> 00:17:17.843
Yes.

00:17:18.032 --> 00:17:18.682
A small cave.

00:17:18.682 --> 00:17:20.283
If robbers attack here,

00:17:20.523 --> 00:17:21.843
we have nowhere to escape.

00:17:51.568 --> 00:17:52.496
Third Master.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.608
This cave isn't ordinary.

00:17:58.288 --> 00:17:59.216
This cave

00:18:00.336 --> 00:18:01.936
has a history spanning over a century.

00:18:03.363 --> 00:18:04.962
Explosives won't work here.

00:18:06.224 --> 00:18:08.048
It appears to be man-made.

00:18:08.784 --> 00:18:10.323
Man-made?

00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:12.816
It would take 100 people
over ten years to carve this.

00:18:14.576 --> 00:18:16.882
Why did that just to dig a cave?

00:18:18.192 --> 00:18:18.960
Yang,

00:18:19.376 --> 00:18:20.560
where does this path lead?

00:18:21.296 --> 00:18:22.576
There's a mountain ahead

00:18:22.672 --> 00:18:24.682
where legend says a deity resides.

00:18:25.283 --> 00:18:26.763
A path built for a deity.

00:18:27.242 --> 00:18:28.162
Possibly.

00:18:28.363 --> 00:18:30.416
But earlier you mentioned

00:18:30.416 --> 00:18:31.728
this place has a snake monster?

00:18:32.016 --> 00:18:34.288
Why didn't the deity
vanquish the snake monster?

00:18:34.832 --> 00:18:36.336
I don't know.

00:18:36.336 --> 00:18:38.162
These are legends passed down by elders.

00:18:38.363 --> 00:18:40.363
I can't say if they are true.

00:18:40.803 --> 00:18:41.803
You made that up, right?

00:19:02.162 --> 00:19:03.083
Who?

00:19:05.682 --> 00:19:06.682
Stop it.

00:19:08.283 --> 00:19:09.242
Scared?

00:19:13.603 --> 00:19:14.922
There are five of us,

00:19:15.123 --> 00:19:16.283
and they only have two.

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:18.402
If we start fighting,

00:19:18.682 --> 00:19:19.962
we might not lose.

00:19:20.843 --> 00:19:22.563
If they actually attack,

00:19:23.642 --> 00:19:24.922
they must have some tricks.

00:19:30.043 --> 00:19:31.363
You're pretty sharp.

00:19:31.523 --> 00:19:32.922
Top student indeed.

00:19:36.283 --> 00:19:37.563
What are you two talking about?

00:19:41.043 --> 00:19:42.043
Young Third Master

00:19:43.202 --> 00:19:44.202
is extraordinary.

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:47.088
He faces such conditions
on the first expedition

00:19:47.088 --> 00:19:48.242
without breaking down.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.442
Nice.

00:19:50.442 --> 00:19:51.440
Young Third Master.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.882
Do you still remember

00:19:52.882 --> 00:19:54.482
your first field work?

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:55.600
In my memories,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.912
early when I was in my diapers,

00:19:56.912 --> 00:19:58.384
I started working with Third Master.

00:19:58.384 --> 00:19:59.248
Cut the crap.

00:19:59.248 --> 00:20:00.603
If you started before me,

00:20:00.803 --> 00:20:01.882
I'd have been

00:20:01.882 --> 00:20:03.043
changing your diapers!

00:20:03.043 --> 00:20:04.016
Don't worry.

00:20:04.016 --> 00:20:04.962
When you're old,

00:20:04.962 --> 00:20:06.283
I'll return your favor.

00:20:14.563 --> 00:20:15.323
He means

00:20:15.323 --> 00:20:16.368
you should stop talking.

00:20:16.368 --> 00:20:17.523
Stop talking.

00:20:17.523 --> 00:20:19.083
It will cause trouble.

00:20:19.563 --> 00:20:20.363
Trouble?

00:20:20.442 --> 00:20:21.642
What kind of trouble?

00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:23.722
I'd like to see what trouble comes.

00:20:27.242 --> 00:20:28.083
Listen.

00:20:28.642 --> 00:20:29.763
Someone is talking.

00:21:20.922 --> 00:21:21.682
Where are they?

00:21:21.962 --> 00:21:22.882
What?

00:21:23.722 --> 00:21:24.682
Where are the two?

00:21:24.682 --> 00:21:25.523
What happened?

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.384
Pan Zi.

00:21:26.384 --> 00:21:27.120
What happened?

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.523
I don't know.

00:21:28.722 --> 00:21:30.123
I heard no splash.

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:31.722
Wait,

00:21:31.803 --> 00:21:32.682
did we all zone out

00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:33.722
for a moment?

00:21:34.123 --> 00:21:35.952
They can't just vanish.

00:21:35.952 --> 00:21:36.688
Oh no!

00:21:36.688 --> 00:21:38.832
Without their smell of bat dung,

00:21:38.832 --> 00:21:39.856
we'd be in trouble.

00:21:39.856 --> 00:21:40.882
They must be hiding.

00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:42.242
Sit! You'll capsize the boat.

00:21:44.784 --> 00:21:45.763
Listen.

00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:50.000
The strange noise stopped.

00:22:01.584 --> 00:22:02.603
Be careful.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.952
Third Master.

00:22:28.432 --> 00:22:29.552
What's in the water?

00:22:58.603 --> 00:22:59.922
Look at his fingers.

00:23:00.563 --> 00:23:02.083
These are no ordinary fingers.

00:23:04.656 --> 00:23:08.752
This is the Twin-Finger Tomb Probing
from ancient Chinese martial arts.

00:23:08.752 --> 00:23:10.283
Developing such martial arts

00:23:11.363 --> 00:23:13.242
takes decades of training.

00:23:28.642 --> 00:23:29.882
This is it earlier.

00:23:30.003 --> 00:23:31.123
It's a water beetle.

00:23:31.682 --> 00:23:32.603
You squashed it

00:23:32.603 --> 00:23:33.722
before I interrogate it!

00:23:33.763 --> 00:23:34.962
This isn't a water beetle,

00:23:35.162 --> 00:23:36.202
but a corpse beetle.

00:23:36.363 --> 00:23:38.563
These are omnivorous creatures.

00:23:40.722 --> 00:23:42.083
I bet there are

00:23:42.642 --> 00:23:45.003
many more of them upstream.

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:47.563
Third Master.

00:23:47.682 --> 00:23:48.962
I guess these corpse beetles

00:23:49.242 --> 00:23:50.323
don't bite living people?

00:23:52.162 --> 00:23:52.962
They don't, usually.

00:23:53.402 --> 00:23:54.162
But when starving,

00:23:54.922 --> 00:23:55.803
they will.

00:23:55.803 --> 00:23:56.922
Do you know about hyenas?

00:23:56.922 --> 00:23:58.402
They usually eat carrion when hungry.

00:23:58.682 --> 00:23:59.922
But when starving,

00:24:00.043 --> 00:24:01.442
they'll even attack buffalo.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:04.722
Then why are they

00:24:05.003 --> 00:24:06.563
loitering around here?

00:24:08.283 --> 00:24:09.482
The carrion in the cave

00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:11.283
are all consumed?

00:24:12.043 --> 00:24:13.882
They were probably fleeing earlier.

00:24:14.402 --> 00:24:15.402
Fleeing?

00:24:16.563 --> 00:24:18.123
Something's approaching,

00:24:18.803 --> 00:24:19.962
and it's something big.

00:24:20.482 --> 00:24:21.642
What is that?

00:24:21.803 --> 00:24:23.043
Explain yourself.

00:24:23.242 --> 00:24:24.202
Let's not dwell on

00:24:24.202 --> 00:24:25.202
what that thing is.

00:24:25.202 --> 00:24:26.323
We should get out.

00:24:26.523 --> 00:24:27.722
We have been here not long.

00:24:27.722 --> 00:24:28.922
It's not too late to go back.

00:24:28.922 --> 00:24:29.763
I agree.

00:24:29.763 --> 00:24:30.843
Let's retreat first.

00:24:31.083 --> 00:24:32.162
We can cross the mountain.

00:24:32.162 --> 00:24:33.363
We might lose a few days,

00:24:33.363 --> 00:24:34.363
but I think it's okay.

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:38.523
Bro.

00:24:38.682 --> 00:24:39.763
Any thoughts?

00:24:41.482 --> 00:24:43.123
They're certain we can't escape.

00:24:43.123 --> 00:24:44.323
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

00:24:45.456 --> 00:24:46.608
The exit is blocked.

00:24:52.162 --> 00:24:54.123
Third Master,
we could retrieve the cattle

00:24:54.123 --> 00:24:55.763
and push the luggage back.

00:24:55.763 --> 00:24:56.642
Fine. You try it.

00:24:56.642 --> 00:24:58.442
The cattle can't even stand on the boat.

00:24:58.642 --> 00:24:59.803
They knew

00:24:59.803 --> 00:25:01.083
they can trap you here.

00:25:02.922 --> 00:25:04.043
I didn't expect

00:25:04.043 --> 00:25:05.642
to be fooled by two village fools!

00:25:06.202 --> 00:25:07.123
Third Master.

00:25:08.083 --> 00:25:09.402
We underestimated them.

00:25:09.603 --> 00:25:10.803
They're capable.

00:25:11.563 --> 00:25:13.003
Not them,

00:25:13.003 --> 00:25:14.563
but this place.

00:25:16.523 --> 00:25:17.843
They're sure

00:25:18.523 --> 00:25:20.642
this place can finish us.

00:25:43.882 --> 00:25:44.944
Third Master.

00:26:49.904 --> 00:26:50.800
Pan Zi!

00:26:51.248 --> 00:26:52.763
Pan Zi!

00:26:55.536 --> 00:26:56.336
Pan Zi!

00:26:56.496 --> 00:26:57.083
Pan Zi!

00:27:05.922 --> 00:27:06.803
Young Third Master.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.288
Wu Xie.

00:27:34.962 --> 00:27:35.722
Wu Xie.

00:28:20.368 --> 00:28:21.296
Get to shore now!
