00:01:44.484 --> 00:01:47.204
These vines are scientifically called
Nine-Headed Snake Cypress.

00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:49.525
They parasitize giant trees.

00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:53.564
The snake cypress
normally extends its vines outward,

00:01:53.564 --> 00:01:55.445
dragging animals inside
to strangle them.

00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:06.365
After feeding, they need to...

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:07.484
Well,

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:09.045
defecate.

00:02:09.404 --> 00:02:11.805
The excrement nourishes the giant tree,

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.805
which in turn feeds the vines.

00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:15.325
Three elements

00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:17.205
form a symbiotic system.

00:02:18.124 --> 00:02:19.564
As for the Tianxin Rock,

00:02:19.564 --> 00:02:22.045
it's like snakeweed near a snake's den.

00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:23.765
Every poison has its antidote.

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:25.245
Understand?

00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:28.325
This works too.

00:02:29.205 --> 00:02:31.245
The platform's surface
contains Tianxin Rock,

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:33.645
so the snake cypress won't come down.

00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:35.724
But you'll be dragged away instantly

00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:37.004
if you leave this area.

00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:40.525
I found some of Ma's belongings earlier.

00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:42.004
I think

00:02:44.085 --> 00:02:45.884
he was dragged in by the snake cypress

00:02:45.884 --> 00:02:47.365
and died nearby.

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:49.284
This settles it.

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:50.604
At least there's closure.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:52.724
Let's go.

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:55.124
We need to get out of here.

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:55.965
Or something else

00:02:55.965 --> 00:02:56.884
might appear.

00:02:57.485 --> 00:02:58.325
Let's go.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:02:59.284
Well,

00:02:59.284 --> 00:03:00.444
shouldn't we wait for Xiaoge?

00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:03.525
Pan Zi, send a signal.

00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:04.085
Okay.

00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:06.004
If he doesn't appear in 15 minutes,

00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:07.404
we'll leave without him.

00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:07.965
Got it.

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:09.844
I believe Xiaoge can protect himself.

00:03:09.844 --> 00:03:10.805
Wu Xie, come here.

00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:12.805
Let me teach you our rules.

00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:16.844
Our rules dictate

00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:18.844
that the deceased's remains
must be returned

00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:20.684
to their original places.

00:03:21.884 --> 00:03:23.645
If someone dies along the way,

00:03:23.884 --> 00:03:25.485
we should try our best

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:26.525
to return them home.

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:27.965
Now handle that fox corpse.

00:03:28.564 --> 00:03:29.604
Go.

00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:30.805
Okay.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:40.765
Pan Zi.

00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:43.365
Can you walk? Come here.

00:03:43.444 --> 00:03:44.485
I'm fine, Third Master.

00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:48.404
I have an idea.

00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:50.604
See this giant tree?

00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:52.805
Look.

00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:55.805
It keeps extending

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:57.525
until the branches and vines

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.925
nearly reach outside the cave entrance.

00:04:00.604 --> 00:04:01.645
So I think

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:04.205
these intertwined branches and vines

00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:05.884
could form

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:07.805
a natural ladder.

00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:11.284
We could climb out this way.

00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:13.245
What do you think?

00:04:13.604 --> 00:04:15.164
With Tianxin Rock, it's possible.

00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:33.685
Although

00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:36.044
I don't know if you were truly a couple,

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:38.445
may your next life

00:04:38.604 --> 00:04:39.685
find you united

00:04:40.804 --> 00:04:42.244
as a joyful, free,

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:44.445
and peaceful couple.

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:04.005
Third Master, watch out!

00:05:04.325 --> 00:05:05.085
Nobody move!

00:05:08.604 --> 00:05:10.565
Third Master, something moved!

00:05:12.404 --> 00:05:13.765
Third Master,

00:05:13.765 --> 00:05:15.885
these chains
seem connected to something.

00:05:19.696 --> 00:05:20.565
Wu.

00:05:20.565 --> 00:05:21.968
There's a mechanism in the hollow.

00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:44.724
What now?

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.685
Why's this bronze casket so massive?

00:05:47.924 --> 00:05:49.364
Not bad.

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:51.765
You actually know
this is called a casket.

00:05:53.565 --> 00:05:55.125
There are so many inscriptions on it.

00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:56.885
Can you read them?

00:05:57.724 --> 00:05:59.125
I only recognize a few characters.

00:06:00.965 --> 00:06:01.844
Leave it.

00:06:01.844 --> 00:06:02.885
Once we confirm it's safe,

00:06:03.445 --> 00:06:04.404
we're leaving.

00:06:10.685 --> 00:06:11.645
Brat,

00:06:12.012 --> 00:06:13.872
didn't you say
you recognized some characters?

00:06:14.844 --> 00:06:16.724
What exactly do they say?

00:06:18.284 --> 00:06:19.504
I can only tell

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.565
that King Shang of Lu
ordered the casket to be made.

00:06:21.724 --> 00:06:22.965
The carvings on it

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:24.244
depict his life story.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.344
Got it. It's King Shang of Lu's
safe deposit box.

00:06:27.344 --> 00:06:29.712
Why do I keep feeling something's wrong?

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.325
When most people

00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:34.804
painstakingly built a safe,

00:06:35.085 --> 00:06:37.005
they'd definitely keep it well hidden.

00:06:37.445 --> 00:06:39.404
So why did they do the opposite

00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:41.804
and set up a mechanism to pull it out?

00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:44.244
And I notice all these surroundings

00:06:44.765 --> 00:06:46.525
show heavy signs of human construction.

00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:49.284
The underground
must be full of mechanisms.

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.205
What? Don't want to leave now

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:52.965
but to stay
and study ancient mechanisms?

00:06:55.325 --> 00:06:56.804
Such sophisticated mechanisms

00:06:57.164 --> 00:06:58.924
don't look thousands of years old.

00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:10.604
There's a sound inside.

00:07:25.484 --> 00:07:26.284
What's happening?

00:07:26.484 --> 00:07:28.205
Is there something alive trapped inside?

00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:32.044
Nothing survives three thousand years
in confinement.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:34.085
Third Master,

00:07:34.844 --> 00:07:36.885
could it be
mechanical components moving?

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:39.005
This mechanism's so deeply concealed.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.724
Maybe solving it

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.164
could lead us to the exit.

00:07:42.164 --> 00:07:43.484
No. We absolutely mustn't.

00:07:43.765 --> 00:07:45.685
This altar
seems part of a bigger system.

00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:47.284
If we trigger one part

00:07:47.844 --> 00:07:49.325
and the entire system activates,

00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:50.224
we'll be doomed.

00:07:50.224 --> 00:07:51.120
- We...
- Enough!

00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:53.325
Are you done yet?

00:07:56.604 --> 00:07:57.804
Xiaoge said

00:07:58.416 --> 00:07:59.804
not to touch anything.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.512
Let's leave.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:05.840
Let's go.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.928
Hold on, guys.

00:08:07.408 --> 00:08:08.848
You're being too cautious.

00:08:10.032 --> 00:08:11.364
Let's return it to its old place.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.064
Pangzi,

00:08:30.064 --> 00:08:31.344
what did you touch?

00:08:32.604 --> 00:08:34.032
I just looked at it.

00:08:34.445 --> 00:08:35.445
It opened by itself.

00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:43.524
Why is there a ship inside?

00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:46.285
Be careful. This ship may be dangerous.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.565
Why's he sitting up?

00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:06.965
Is he really alive?

00:09:08.165 --> 00:09:08.925
Are you blind?

00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:10.205
Can't you see the bracket behind

00:09:10.205 --> 00:09:11.644
propping him up?

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.952
It scared me.

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:17.325
I was scared.

00:09:19.524 --> 00:09:20.965
Then what exactly is this thing?

00:09:21.685 --> 00:09:23.604
This must be the Jade Burial Armor.

00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:24.764
Jade Burial Armor?

00:09:24.976 --> 00:09:27.004
It was just a legend.

00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:28.724
I never thought it'd truly exist.

00:09:29.325 --> 00:09:30.285
It's said

00:09:31.248 --> 00:09:32.524
the Jade Burial Armor

00:09:33.004 --> 00:09:34.484
allows its wearer to be rejuvenated.

00:09:35.205 --> 00:09:35.888
Look here.

00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:39.728
These seem to be
black melted crusts from burning.

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:41.968
I think this is

00:09:41.968 --> 00:09:43.165
meteorite jade.

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:45.244
Meteorite jade?

00:09:46.805 --> 00:09:47.792
Good heavens.

00:09:48.364 --> 00:09:49.840
No wonder it was locked away.

00:09:50.604 --> 00:09:51.724
Stop overthinking it.

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:52.805
Cover it and let's go.

00:09:53.104 --> 00:09:53.764
Third Master,

00:09:54.224 --> 00:09:55.984
what's all this in the cabin?

00:10:00.124 --> 00:10:01.325
Why touch it?

00:10:03.405 --> 00:10:04.685
It's human skin.

00:10:05.565 --> 00:10:06.325
Human skin?

00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:07.524
Yes.

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:08.644
This ship was probably

00:10:08.644 --> 00:10:11.045
part of an alchemist's
immortality ritual.

00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:13.840
(Ancient alchemists
linked boat journeys on rivers)

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.632
(with the circulation of vital energy.)

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.325
(Folklore tells of magic boats)

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.805
(that cross the Sea of Mortality
to gain immortality.)

00:10:20.405 --> 00:10:22.445
I've heard a legend that by swallowing

00:10:22.445 --> 00:10:23.405
the corpse beetle king

00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:25.584
wrapped by meteorite jade powder,

00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:26.844
wearing Jade Burial Armor,

00:10:26.844 --> 00:10:28.045
and lying in this magic boat

00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:30.524
to cross the Sea of Mortality
in slumber,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.624
the Jade Burial Armor's wearer

00:10:32.624 --> 00:10:34.644
can shed skin every five centuries,

00:10:34.644 --> 00:10:36.656
growing younger each time.

00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:40.004
This amount of shed skin
suggests three cycles.

00:10:41.685 --> 00:10:43.244
He seems to be breathing.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.000
Is he still alive?

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.104
There's a loose thread here.

00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:54.644
If we unravel this,

00:10:54.644 --> 00:10:56.724
could we check if it's alive?

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.128
Don't!

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.644
What are you doing?

00:11:35.024 --> 00:11:35.792
Pangzi!

00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:38.352
What are you doing?

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.848
Xiaoge always has reasons
for his actions.

00:11:41.524 --> 00:11:42.544
Let him explain first.

00:11:44.925 --> 00:11:46.004
Move aside.

00:11:48.325 --> 00:11:49.244
Fine.

00:11:49.685 --> 00:11:50.805
There are more of you.

00:12:09.424 --> 00:12:10.445
Xiaoge,

00:12:11.244 --> 00:12:12.364
why did you do that?

00:12:15.572 --> 00:12:17.072
The person in the Jade Burial Armor

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.440
was eaten by the corpse beetle king
long ago.

00:12:23.445 --> 00:12:25.525
Now, only the dormant
corpse beetle king remains,

00:12:25.525 --> 00:12:28.004
along with its generations
of offspring over the years.

00:12:31.632 --> 00:12:34.364
To deceive the world
into believing in immortality,

00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:37.244
ancient alchemists
fabricated such a preposterous theory.

00:12:37.744 --> 00:12:38.672
That's right.

00:12:39.965 --> 00:12:41.724
With their limited ancient knowledge,

00:12:42.224 --> 00:12:43.844
they didn't know that long exposure

00:12:43.844 --> 00:12:45.285
to the corpse beetle king's venom

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.445
causes toxic reactions in humans,

00:12:47.728 --> 00:12:49.292
making their skin gradually slough off.

00:12:49.392 --> 00:12:50.480
And since ancient people

00:12:50.544 --> 00:12:52.464
desperately sought eternal life,

00:12:53.285 --> 00:12:55.484
ancient alchemists
misinterpreted the skin shedding

00:12:55.952 --> 00:12:57.776
as proof the armor's wearer was alive.

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:00.464
So they arbitrarily claimed

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:03.484
that after two millennia in the armor,

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.290
the corpse beetle king would die

00:13:05.712 --> 00:13:08.016
and the armor's wearer
could awaken immortal.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:09.520
It ensured

00:13:09.965 --> 00:13:11.056
no ruler could punish them

00:13:11.484 --> 00:13:13.045
even when the immortality proved false.

00:13:13.552 --> 00:13:15.184
Had you removed that armor earlier,

00:13:15.632 --> 00:13:17.232
the corpse beetle king would've awakened

00:13:17.584 --> 00:13:19.184
and controlled the armor to attack us.

00:13:19.792 --> 00:13:22.045
Fighting the armor controlled
by the corpse beetle king

00:13:22.045 --> 00:13:24.244
in the cave full of snake cypress' vines

00:13:25.644 --> 00:13:27.085
would've doomed your entire party.

00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:48.528
You've lived long enough.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.085
Was the original wearer

00:14:15.685 --> 00:14:17.124
truly King Shang of Lu?

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:18.925
All you seek

00:14:20.604 --> 00:14:22.045
is in the Purple Jade Box.

00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:55.844
It's a golden-threaded manuscript.

00:14:56.325 --> 00:14:57.405
Its fibers

00:14:57.405 --> 00:14:58.965
were interwoven with gold strands.

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:00.484
The conservation is remarkable.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.440
What's written here?

00:15:04.176 --> 00:15:05.648
I can only decipher parts.

00:15:06.576 --> 00:15:07.984
It chronicles

00:15:08.604 --> 00:15:10.672
King Shang of Lu's life journey

00:15:10.672 --> 00:15:11.884
from birth to death.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.685
Too much to read.

00:15:14.165 --> 00:15:15.344
But two key events

00:15:15.344 --> 00:15:16.685
stand out.

00:15:22.565 --> 00:15:23.484
(First,)

00:15:23.884 --> 00:15:26.085
(King Shang of Lu's
acquisition of the Gui Seal.)

00:15:28.604 --> 00:15:29.445
(He pursued)

00:15:30.085 --> 00:15:31.685
(an alchemist with his troops)

00:15:33.085 --> 00:15:33.724
(and entered)

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:35.724
(an ancient tomb of unknown age.)

00:16:01.285 --> 00:16:03.085
(The alchemist suddenly transformed)

00:16:03.844 --> 00:16:05.165
(into a giant snake.)

00:16:11.884 --> 00:16:13.165
(Undeterred, King Shang of Lu)

00:16:14.165 --> 00:16:16.004
(drew his sword to slay it.)

00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:19.600
(The snake reverted to human form.)

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.848
Spare my life!

00:16:20.848 --> 00:16:22.085
(He knelt to beg.)

00:16:22.085 --> 00:16:23.405
Spare my life!

00:16:27.405 --> 00:16:28.405
I beg you!

00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:29.724
Spare my life!

00:16:30.484 --> 00:16:32.080
Spare me,

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.004
and I'll give you two treasures.

00:16:34.608 --> 00:16:36.205
One grants you

00:16:36.205 --> 00:16:38.124
supreme power,

00:16:38.124 --> 00:16:39.120
and the other

00:16:39.405 --> 00:16:41.764
grants you immortality.

00:16:42.205 --> 00:16:44.176
Just spare me.

00:16:45.244 --> 00:16:46.644
Please

00:16:46.844 --> 00:16:48.272
don't kill me.

00:16:48.272 --> 00:16:49.644
I beg you!

00:16:52.176 --> 00:16:52.965
(After learning)

00:16:52.965 --> 00:16:55.085
(the treasures' secrets,
King Shang of Lu)

00:16:55.085 --> 00:16:56.644
(realized their magic)

00:16:57.328 --> 00:16:59.445
(and thought such knowledge belonged)

00:16:59.445 --> 00:17:01.045
(only to the heavens.)

00:17:01.776 --> 00:17:02.640
(So)

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:04.524
(he killed the alchemist.)

00:17:18.576 --> 00:17:21.456
(Gui Seal)

00:17:24.784 --> 00:17:26.365
What a ruthless man!

00:17:26.965 --> 00:17:27.925
Two treasures?

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.032
One's the Gui Seal.

00:17:30.224 --> 00:17:31.524
What's the other one?

00:17:32.524 --> 00:17:33.764
Is it the Jade Burial Armor?

00:17:35.728 --> 00:17:37.008
Patience.

00:17:37.445 --> 00:17:38.405
There's more.

00:17:43.564 --> 00:17:44.205
(Later,)

00:17:44.804 --> 00:17:46.044
(with his army advisor,)

00:17:46.044 --> 00:17:47.445
(Iron-Faced Scholar's guidance,)

00:17:48.112 --> 00:17:49.776
(King Shang of Lu requested more troops)

00:17:49.776 --> 00:17:51.484
(from the ruler, citing war.)

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:53.965
(He divided them into two forces.)

00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:55.376
(He led one himself)

00:17:55.376 --> 00:17:56.564
(to search around,)

00:17:56.605 --> 00:17:58.205
(seeming to be looking for something.)

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.072
(The Iron-Faced Scholar
led the other force)

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:02.512
(to do construction)

00:18:02.928 --> 00:18:04.284
(and built this kiln.)

00:18:10.445 --> 00:18:12.125
(When everything was ready,)

00:18:12.605 --> 00:18:14.885
(the Iron-Faced Scholar
gave King Shang of Lu a pill.)

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:18.004
(King Shang of Lu then faked his death)

00:18:18.004 --> 00:18:19.445
(in front of the ruler.)

00:18:34.044 --> 00:18:37.484
(To conceal the kiln's location,)

00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:39.205
(he slaughtered all the soldiers,)

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:40.764
(only leaving a loyal man)

00:18:40.764 --> 00:18:42.244
(and woman as trusted aides)

00:18:42.244 --> 00:18:43.165
(to bury him.)

00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:44.605
Thank you.

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:47.965
When I succeed,

00:18:49.244 --> 00:18:51.685
I shall remember your contributions.

00:19:12.764 --> 00:19:15.125
Who did King Shang of Lu think he was,

00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:17.365
killing so many for personal gain?

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.605
Let's sort this out.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.804
King Shang of Lu's goal was immortality.

00:19:22.484 --> 00:19:23.764
He likely searched

00:19:24.165 --> 00:19:25.284
for the Jade Burial Armor.

00:19:25.724 --> 00:19:27.484
That all makes sense.

00:19:28.004 --> 00:19:29.764
But why build a kiln?

00:19:30.244 --> 00:19:32.724
How's the kiln related to immortality?

00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:34.004
Building the kiln

00:19:34.445 --> 00:19:35.804
was probably to disguise

00:19:35.804 --> 00:19:36.925
his true purpose.

00:19:37.965 --> 00:19:39.284
Even if intruders came,

00:19:39.405 --> 00:19:41.605
they'd see only an abandoned kiln,

00:19:41.605 --> 00:19:42.965
deeming it worthless.

00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:44.685
None would think King Shang of Lu

00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:46.365
hid himself inside a giant tree,

00:19:46.764 --> 00:19:48.445
waiting through two millennia

00:19:48.724 --> 00:19:49.885
for immortality.

00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:50.965
Well.

00:19:51.084 --> 00:19:52.365
After killing so many

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:53.685
and expending such effort,

00:19:53.764 --> 00:19:55.564
he became a mere breeding ground

00:19:55.564 --> 00:19:57.125
for the parasites' growth.

00:19:58.165 --> 00:19:58.764
Wait,

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:01.405
about the Iron-Faced Scholar
who advised him,

00:20:01.405 --> 00:20:02.965
the manuscript didn't mention

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.445
his final ending.

00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:06.704
Did he die in the tomb too?

00:20:07.216 --> 00:20:09.360
A man that cunning

00:20:10.064 --> 00:20:13.365
would've foreseen
King Shang of Lu's ruthlessness.

00:20:16.284 --> 00:20:17.872
He was too shrewd to blindly serve

00:20:18.576 --> 00:20:19.564
to his death.

00:20:20.324 --> 00:20:21.392
Of course not.

00:20:22.512 --> 00:20:24.176
Because the one in the Jade Burial Armor

00:20:24.176 --> 00:20:25.205
wasn't King Shang of Lu

00:20:25.284 --> 00:20:26.365
but the advisor himself.

00:20:32.365 --> 00:20:33.365
You're saying

00:20:34.205 --> 00:20:35.408
that at the final moment,

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.104
they switched places?

00:20:40.084 --> 00:20:41.484
The advisor plotted meticulously

00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:43.760
to exploit King Shang of Lu's power

00:20:44.464 --> 00:20:46.764
for his own immortality quest.

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:48.560
How do you know?

00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:51.605
You speak like an eyewitness.

00:20:52.165 --> 00:20:53.405
I didn't witness it,

00:20:53.925 --> 00:20:55.984
but read a silk manuscript

00:20:56.605 --> 00:20:58.928
which documented
the Iron-Faced Scholar's autobiography.

00:21:26.835 --> 00:21:28.365
King Shang of Lu planned for so long,

00:21:28.592 --> 00:21:30.365
only for someone else to benefit.

00:21:30.845 --> 00:21:32.365
Maybe even he never anticipated that.

00:21:32.564 --> 00:21:33.744
His bloodlust cursed him.

00:21:35.645 --> 00:21:37.685
It's karmic retribution.

00:21:39.004 --> 00:21:39.885
Alright.

00:21:40.752 --> 00:21:41.488
Let's move.

00:21:43.696 --> 00:21:44.624
Xiaoge,

00:21:45.244 --> 00:21:46.965
what about the severed head?

00:21:49.084 --> 00:21:50.845
I merely granted him peace.

00:21:52.965 --> 00:21:54.512
That's it then.

00:21:54.768 --> 00:21:56.688
- Let's reseal the bronze plate.
- Don't touch it.

00:21:56.885 --> 00:21:58.992
Inform the archaeologists
when we surface.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.016
What?

00:22:21.712 --> 00:22:23.248
The mechanism won't reset,

00:22:23.248 --> 00:22:23.888
Third Master.

00:22:25.584 --> 00:22:26.736
Return the remains.

00:22:28.484 --> 00:22:30.445
Forgive our trespass.

00:22:46.768 --> 00:22:48.084
Something bit me.

00:22:49.488 --> 00:22:50.804
Da Kui, are you okay?

00:22:52.464 --> 00:22:53.520
- Da Kui?
- Da Kui?

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.248
It's poisonous.

00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:56.176
Da Kui!

00:22:56.176 --> 00:22:58.365
- Da Kui!
- Don't touch him. Move aside.

00:23:08.464 --> 00:23:09.744
Don't kill it!

00:23:09.744 --> 00:23:10.672
Don't step on it!

00:23:14.416 --> 00:23:15.728
It's the corpse beetle king.

00:23:16.208 --> 00:23:18.224
Its death unleashes the swarm.

00:23:18.448 --> 00:23:20.432
- I can't suppress so many beetles.
- Wait...

00:23:32.784 --> 00:23:33.885
Da Kui?

00:23:34.544 --> 00:23:36.004
Da Kui, wake up!

00:23:50.768 --> 00:23:51.728
Third Uncle.

00:23:51.728 --> 00:23:52.976
- Da Kui?
- Third Uncle!

00:24:01.808 --> 00:24:02.800
There are too many.

00:24:38.128 --> 00:24:40.405
I knew there were
seven types of monsters here.

00:24:42.044 --> 00:24:43.568
The snake cypress parasitized it.

00:24:44.688 --> 00:24:45.968
Use Tianxin Rock.

00:24:59.536 --> 00:25:00.432
Listen to me.

00:25:00.432 --> 00:25:01.808
The distance is too great.

00:25:01.808 --> 00:25:03.004
Wait until it gets closer.

00:25:03.004 --> 00:25:04.324
I'll count to three.

00:25:04.324 --> 00:25:05.484
Let's throw them together.

00:25:08.284 --> 00:25:09.205
One.

00:25:15.984 --> 00:25:16.944
Two.

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:20.208
Three!

00:25:24.304 --> 00:25:25.104
Go!

00:25:27.824 --> 00:25:28.816
Wu Xie!

00:25:39.645 --> 00:25:40.484
Go away!

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.960
- Let's go!
- Da Kui.

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:45.648
He's dying.

00:25:45.648 --> 00:25:46.524
Da Kui!

00:25:46.524 --> 00:25:47.984
No. We must take him with us.

00:25:48.528 --> 00:25:50.885
- Don't touch his wound. It's poisoned.
- Da Kui, you're awake.

00:25:56.304 --> 00:25:57.232
Da Kui!

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.336
Da Kui!

00:26:07.152 --> 00:26:07.824
Da Kui!

00:26:09.968 --> 00:26:10.672
Pan Zi!

00:26:12.464 --> 00:26:13.520
Da Kui!

00:26:14.672 --> 00:26:15.804
Da Kui!

00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:18.685
Da Kui!

00:26:20.592 --> 00:26:21.564
Da Kui!

00:26:21.564 --> 00:26:23.084
Corpse beetles are coming. Let's go!

00:26:23.504 --> 00:26:24.400
Go!

00:27:05.328 --> 00:27:06.128
Third Master!

00:27:07.824 --> 00:27:09.328
Third Master! Third Master!

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.205
- Pangzi!
- Wu Xie!

00:27:49.484 --> 00:27:50.524
Go!

00:27:50.524 --> 00:27:51.792
- Hurry!
- Go!

00:28:06.192 --> 00:28:07.024
Pan Zi!

00:28:07.024 --> 00:28:07.925
Pan Zi!

00:28:07.925 --> 00:28:08.688
- Pan Zi!
- Pan Zi!

00:28:12.004 --> 00:28:12.925
Third Master!

00:28:13.804 --> 00:28:14.724
Third Master!

00:28:20.048 --> 00:28:20.752
It's coal.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.405
- Pan Zi!
- Pan Zi!

00:29:21.645 --> 00:29:22.645
Wu Xie!

00:29:24.165 --> 00:29:25.365
Get away from me!

00:29:28.324 --> 00:29:30.004
Pangzi, how are you?

00:29:31.856 --> 00:29:33.004
Wu!

00:29:34.605 --> 00:29:35.472
Wu!

00:29:36.016 --> 00:29:37.040
Wu!

00:29:46.244 --> 00:29:48.004
You stinky octopus!

00:29:48.044 --> 00:29:50.365
I'll teppanyaki you when I get down!

00:30:10.736 --> 00:30:12.016
Pan Zi, are you okay?

00:30:12.016 --> 00:30:13.104
I'm fine.

00:30:14.992 --> 00:30:15.888
Everyone!

00:30:17.072 --> 00:30:18.672
Get to the tree hollow!

00:30:23.056 --> 00:30:24.496
Get in the tree hollow! Hurry!

00:30:24.496 --> 00:30:26.128
- Hurry. Let's go!
- Go!

00:30:29.845 --> 00:30:30.480
Quick!

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.344
Over here!

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.685
What kind of explosive is this?
It's so powerful.

00:30:57.685 --> 00:30:58.896
This entire cave-dwelling

00:30:59.165 --> 00:31:01.008
is actually one massive kiln.

00:31:01.232 --> 00:31:03.244
The walls are lined with coal.

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:09.125
And the chambers interconnect.

00:31:09.645 --> 00:31:10.804
I've reignited

00:31:10.804 --> 00:31:11.764
the kiln.

00:31:11.764 --> 00:31:13.405
Bigger explosions are coming.

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:15.724
Coal produces methane gas.

00:31:15.724 --> 00:31:16.688
Let's go now!

00:31:17.552 --> 00:31:18.416
Let's go.

00:31:18.928 --> 00:31:19.764
Let's go!

00:31:20.336 --> 00:31:21.072
Hurry!

00:31:41.872 --> 00:31:42.845
Third Master.

00:31:42.845 --> 00:31:43.764
Keep going, Pan Zi.

00:31:43.764 --> 00:31:44.685
We're almost there.

00:31:44.885 --> 00:31:45.776
Don't look down.

00:31:45.776 --> 00:31:46.764
Third Master.

00:31:47.248 --> 00:31:48.365
Third Master, listen.

00:31:48.845 --> 00:31:49.764
I...

00:31:50.205 --> 00:31:51.445
I can't climb anymore.

00:31:52.044 --> 00:31:53.845
Third Master. Third Master.

00:31:54.685 --> 00:31:55.645
You go.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.284
Wu!

00:32:25.168 --> 00:32:26.032
Da Kui!

00:32:26.032 --> 00:32:26.885
Da Kui!

00:32:35.484 --> 00:32:36.432
Da Kui!

00:32:37.328 --> 00:32:38.064
Da Kui!

00:32:38.764 --> 00:32:41.072
- Da Kui!
- Young Third Master, stay back!

00:32:41.405 --> 00:32:42.365
Da Kui, listen to me.

00:32:42.365 --> 00:32:43.564
We can get out.

00:32:43.564 --> 00:32:44.845
Once we're out, you'll be saved.

00:32:44.845 --> 00:32:45.845
Listen to me!

00:32:48.645 --> 00:32:50.405
Take care of my mom for me.

00:32:56.645 --> 00:32:57.605
Da Kui!

00:32:58.576 --> 00:32:59.856
Da Kui!

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.365
Da Kui...

00:33:11.588 --> 00:33:14.375
(Address and phone number)

00:33:21.776 --> 00:33:22.804
Wu!

00:33:24.048 --> 00:33:25.484
Wu, are you okay?

00:33:53.488 --> 00:33:55.804
(Young Third Master, stay back!)

00:33:58.125 --> 00:33:59.605
(Listen to me!)

00:33:59.605 --> 00:34:01.125
(Take care of my mom for me.)

00:34:04.004 --> 00:34:05.484
I'm sorry.

00:34:07.504 --> 00:34:08.368
Wu!

00:34:09.488 --> 00:34:10.352
Wu!

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.604
Wu, what's wrong?

00:34:16.176 --> 00:34:17.445
Leave me behind.

00:34:17.456 --> 00:34:19.845
- What?
- Just climb! I've been poisoned.

00:34:20.004 --> 00:34:21.164
Hang in there.

00:34:21.684 --> 00:34:22.845
I'm coming to you.

00:34:22.925 --> 00:34:23.845
Wait for me.

00:34:23.925 --> 00:34:24.925
Don't come over.

00:34:24.925 --> 00:34:25.765
Cut that.

00:34:27.845 --> 00:34:28.845
Let me check.

00:34:30.484 --> 00:34:31.524
You're fine.

00:34:31.845 --> 00:34:33.564
The poison's already subsided.

00:34:34.352 --> 00:34:35.504
Look at your complexion.

00:34:35.952 --> 00:34:38.365
Rosy cheeks. You look healthier than me.

00:34:38.365 --> 00:34:39.445
Don't assume you'll die

00:34:39.445 --> 00:34:40.400
from every tiny sign.

00:34:41.004 --> 00:34:42.164
You watched too many movies.

00:34:42.564 --> 00:34:43.564
Let's go.

00:34:43.644 --> 00:34:44.684
Hurry.

00:34:45.232 --> 00:34:46.564
Be careful.

00:34:48.805 --> 00:34:49.725
Take it slow.

00:34:58.604 --> 00:34:59.536
Pan Zi, listen to me.

00:34:59.536 --> 00:35:01.204
Let's go, okay?

00:35:02.285 --> 00:35:03.696
We're almost there. Come on.

00:35:04.484 --> 00:35:05.325
If you don't leave,

00:35:05.965 --> 00:35:07.405
I'm not leaving either.

00:35:07.885 --> 00:35:09.684
Okay? Promise me.

00:35:13.004 --> 00:35:14.245
Let's go, Pan Zi.

00:35:14.805 --> 00:35:15.445
Come on.

00:35:17.965 --> 00:35:18.768
Go!

00:35:22.032 --> 00:35:22.885
Go!

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.336
Go!

00:35:48.245 --> 00:35:49.488
I see the exit, Pan Zi.

00:35:51.184 --> 00:35:52.368
Where's Young Third Master?

00:35:57.084 --> 00:35:58.124
They're below.

00:35:58.124 --> 00:35:59.376
Pangzi's watching over him.

00:36:01.684 --> 00:36:02.564
I'll get you up first,

00:36:02.564 --> 00:36:03.604
and then fetch them.

00:36:07.216 --> 00:36:08.004
Let's go.

00:36:17.776 --> 00:36:18.832
One, two, three.

00:36:26.285 --> 00:36:27.124
Why do you stop?

00:36:27.765 --> 00:36:28.604
Keep moving.

00:36:28.845 --> 00:36:29.684
Someone's over there.

00:36:30.128 --> 00:36:31.684
They're waving at me.

00:36:31.684 --> 00:36:32.925
Are you hallucinating?

00:36:33.684 --> 00:36:34.204
Move now,

00:36:34.204 --> 00:36:35.564
or we'll both be seeing

00:36:35.644 --> 00:36:36.765
Ox-Head and Horse-Face.

00:36:37.564 --> 00:36:38.604
You go up first.

00:36:38.604 --> 00:36:39.696
I'll check it out.

00:36:56.752 --> 00:36:57.885
(Ma Zhihong)
I was wrong.

00:37:00.644 --> 00:37:01.564
Who's there?

00:37:11.285 --> 00:37:12.405
Let's get out of here.

00:37:14.325 --> 00:37:15.204
Hurry!

00:37:36.004 --> 00:37:37.925
- Pangzi!
- Wu, are you okay?

00:37:38.124 --> 00:37:39.124
I'm fine.

00:37:41.365 --> 00:37:42.405
Wu Xie!

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:48.285
Third Uncle!

00:37:49.484 --> 00:37:50.204
Wu Xie,

00:37:50.524 --> 00:37:51.524
grab the rope!

00:37:53.484 --> 00:37:54.245
Pangzi!

00:37:54.445 --> 00:37:55.285
Pangzi!

00:37:55.325 --> 00:37:56.044
We're saved!

00:37:56.044 --> 00:37:56.885
What?

00:37:56.925 --> 00:37:58.405
I've got rope here. Come quick!

00:38:13.616 --> 00:38:14.512
Hurry!

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.604
Pangzi,

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.640
hurry!

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:21.245
Come on.

00:38:23.376 --> 00:38:25.004
