(Even Divine Beasts Can Get Jealous)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360
Edict of Emperor of Hong.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.960
First year of Qianyuan,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.720
in the cyclical year of Yimou,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.440
third month, day of Gengyin.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.560
Princess Yuanxi, Ji Qingci,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.520
daughter of Lord Yi.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.480
Gentle in nature, sincere in virtue,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.840
gifted with wisdom,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.280
fit to bear great responsibility.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.000
Hereby established
as heiress to Lord Yi.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.480
So decreed.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.680
Long live

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.880
His Majesty.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.760
Qingci, don't be too depressed.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.960
No one could have imagined

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.160
Ji Yuanying would kill her own father
and then take her own life.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.510
You've lost
your closest kin so suddenly.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.600
You must take care of yourself.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.120
Thank you for your concern.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.960
Brother, this is my father's written confession.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.560
(Out of greed and envy,
I plotted against the Mu Residence,)

00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:48.400
(whose loyalty spanned generations,
and sought to destroy them.)

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.040
(Complainant: Yi Mei)
(Recorded by: Zhang)

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.360
I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.720
My father may have sinned,
but he is gone now.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.200
May your anger be appeased.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.720
His mistakes

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200
are not yours to bear.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.520
Rise.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.920
I, too,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.760
struggle to believe
my father would do such a thing.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.240
But since he wrote this
with his own hand,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.720
guilt must have weighed on him.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.840
It was with fear and shame

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.400
that I presented this to Your Majesty.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.840
Be at ease.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.080
Lord Yi has passed away.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.680
Even if he erred,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.280
I will not punish you.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.320
And as for the Mu Residence…

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.880
The deceased are no longer with us.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.400
There's no need
to pursue this matter further.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.600
I don't believe that's right.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.680
I beg Your Majesty to let me

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.960
uncover the truth
behind the Mu Residence case.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.040
The case of Grand Tutor Mu Heng?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.760
I am humbled

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.080
by your grace.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.600
But my father's confession

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.080
unsettles me.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.400
I fear his name left stained,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.880
or that he truly

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.960
wronged the innocent.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.440
I only wish

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.400
to set his soul at peace.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.100
You have my permission
to investigate the Mu Residence case.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.400
You have always been
pure-hearted and kind.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.960
Brother, this is my guard.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.080
He's saved me many times.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.040
We're as close as siblings.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.560
As close as siblings?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.920
Brother,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.600
I made these pastries myself.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.320
Please try them.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.280
Please pardon him.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.760
He only did that
out of concern for my safety.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.440
Let me make you some tea.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.960
Brother.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.160
He's from the martial world.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320
He can be a bit eccentric,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.720
but he is skilled.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.520
What skill could

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.200
the uncultured have?

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.440
Qingci,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.960
my guards are masters at moving unseen.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.520
They protect you from the shadows.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.640
You'd never notice,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.960
let alone feel

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.160
they're in the way.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.640
Tomorrow, I'll choose a few of the best

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.280
and send them to you.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.480
Forgive me, Your Highness, for the disruption.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.400
But Qingci,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.760
even a guard should have some manners.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.040
Why not let me

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.960
find you a few eunuchs who can fight?

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.040
What do you think?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.440
I trust him.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.680
Since you insist,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.800
I'll say no more.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.440
Oh, right.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.640
The Lantern Festival is coming soon.
The palace will host a grand banquet.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.560
You must attend.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.440
It'll be your first festival
since returning.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.080
Of course. I'll be there

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.000
to wish Your Majesty joy and peace.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.960
It's sweet.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.160
Those are sour date pastries.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.480
Blessings to Your Majesty for joy
and longevity on the Lantern Festival.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.360
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.520
All rise.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.960
Today is the Lantern Festival.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.840
Drink and feast to your heart's content.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.320
No one shall until they're satisfied.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.600
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.400
Why hasn't the heiress of Lord Yi

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.320
arrived yet?

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.360
The invitation said
she's already in the palace.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.200
The heiress of Lord Yi has arrived.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.840
I, Ji Qingci,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.280
wish Your Majesty peace and joy
on the Lantern Festival.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.160
Long live Your Majesty.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.360
Rise.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.760
I've prepared a performance

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.960
I wish to present to Your Majesty.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.480
All right.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.000
By all means.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.760
