00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:47.344
Dandan?

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:51.464
Dandan?

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:02.264
Dandan?

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.305
Dandan?

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:07.785
Dandan?

00:02:11.744 --> 00:02:12.624
Dandan?

00:02:20.464 --> 00:02:21.545
Dandan?

00:02:24.904 --> 00:02:25.784
Dandan?

00:02:30.464 --> 00:02:31.504
Dandan?

00:02:48.464 --> 00:02:49.464
Mountain God,

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:50.904
sorry for disturbing you.

00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:52.464
I'm just here to find my dog.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:53.585
I'll leave once I find him.

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:11.705
Dandan?

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:13.425
Dandan?

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:15.105
Wait for me.

00:03:15.585 --> 00:03:16.744
I'm coming to save you.

00:03:41.464 --> 00:03:42.344
Dandan?

00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:44.265
Dandan?

00:03:48.464 --> 00:03:49.265
Dandan?

00:03:56.224 --> 00:03:57.064
Dandan?

00:04:06.904 --> 00:04:07.744
Dandan?

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:11.385
Dandan?

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.145
Young Third Master,

00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:33.264
look here.

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:38.104
And here.

00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:39.745
What does it say?

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:43.945
What's the connection between this kiln
and Mount Shending?

00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:48.265
Does it mention that snake-like monster?

00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:58.945
It says back then,

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:00.585
a man from Lu

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:03.544
possessed Shao Weng's arts
to command ghost soldiers.

00:05:03.945 --> 00:05:04.945
What does that mean?

00:05:09.505 --> 00:05:11.784
These carvings tell the legend
of King Shang of Lu.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.104
The first half matches
the silk manuscript exactly.

00:05:22.104 --> 00:05:23.385
It matches the manuscript?

00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:24.984
But the content here

00:05:24.984 --> 00:05:26.344
is more detailed and bizarre

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:28.224
than the manuscript's.

00:05:30.784 --> 00:05:31.585
Third Master.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:33.025
Third Master,

00:05:33.424 --> 00:05:34.984
the kiln and the mountain's secrets

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:36.544
might be recorded on these walls.

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:38.025
Read it.

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:38.984
Read it aloud.

00:05:40.304 --> 00:05:41.145
Read.

00:05:50.544 --> 00:05:52.224
(The rock carvings)

00:05:52.344 --> 00:05:54.304
(told an extremely bizarre story.)

00:05:54.784 --> 00:05:55.864
(But I believed this story)

00:05:55.864 --> 00:05:57.185
(must be fabricated.)

00:05:58.705 --> 00:05:59.784
(How could something)

00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:02.544
(so inconceivable exist in this world?)

00:06:07.705 --> 00:06:09.505
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:11.025
Read it out loud.

00:06:11.025 --> 00:06:12.185
Okay, Third Uncle.

00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:14.265
It says

00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:17.265
King Shang of Lu
was once a vassal of Lu State.

00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:20.864
He possessed a Gui Seal from birth

00:06:21.585 --> 00:06:23.424
that enhanced his soldiers' strength.

00:06:24.664 --> 00:06:26.304
(Whenever he displayed the seal,)

00:06:26.705 --> 00:06:28.625
(his soldiers fought)

00:06:28.864 --> 00:06:30.585
(without feeling pain or hunger.)

00:06:31.304 --> 00:06:32.104
(And)

00:06:32.104 --> 00:06:33.984
(the captured enemy soldiers)

00:06:34.104 --> 00:06:35.745
(who saw the Gui Seal)

00:06:35.904 --> 00:06:37.544
(would immediately pledge loyalty.)

00:06:38.904 --> 00:06:40.224
(Thus he conquered all)

00:06:40.424 --> 00:06:42.424
(and was titled by the Lu State's ruler)

00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:43.825
(as King of Lu,)

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.360
(or King Shang of Lu, by himself.)

00:06:46.385 --> 00:06:47.065
(Back then,)

00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:48.825
(kings couldn't surpass state rulers.)

00:06:49.344 --> 00:06:51.424
(So his self-proclamation
as king was an overreach.)

00:06:52.104 --> 00:06:53.145
Then one day,

00:06:53.464 --> 00:06:55.585
he requested an audience
with the ruler of Lu State,

00:06:56.424 --> 00:06:58.424
(claiming prolonged use of the Gui Seal)

00:06:58.424 --> 00:06:59.945
(had left him frail)

00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:02.265
(and requiring feigned death
to recuperate.)

00:07:03.104 --> 00:07:05.625
(He sought permission
to retreat for recovery.)

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:08.705
(The ruler granted his request.)

00:07:09.864 --> 00:07:12.224
(After kowtowing,)

00:07:13.104 --> 00:07:15.065
(he entered suspended animation.)

00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:31.304
(Believing he'd return,)

00:07:32.424 --> 00:07:33.705
(the ruler preserved his body)

00:07:34.224 --> 00:07:36.344
at Mount Shending.

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:39.424
Body? You mean corpse.

00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:41.265
He clearly couldn't last and died.

00:07:41.705 --> 00:07:42.784
You said

00:07:43.104 --> 00:07:44.424
King Shang of Lu's body

00:07:44.424 --> 00:07:46.664
was preserved at Mount Shending.

00:07:46.864 --> 00:07:48.065
(It's right here.)

00:07:49.825 --> 00:07:53.304
(So the ruler back then
constructed this site)

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:56.025
and assigned someone
called Seven to guard here.

00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:00.385
(Could that thing in the kiln be Seven?)

00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:04.505
This story makes no sense.

00:08:04.664 --> 00:08:07.104
Why would the ruler build a kiln

00:08:07.304 --> 00:08:09.104
to preserve someone's corpse?

00:08:10.304 --> 00:08:12.344
The ruler wanted him to return

00:08:12.505 --> 00:08:13.544
as quickly as possible

00:08:13.705 --> 00:08:14.864
to continue serving him.

00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:17.145
So he built this place for him.

00:08:17.145 --> 00:08:18.984
To build large structures
in ancient times,

00:08:19.185 --> 00:08:20.825
they always used local materials.

00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:22.145
This kiln was likely used

00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:23.784
to fire bricks, tiles, and offerings.

00:08:24.784 --> 00:08:25.904
There must also be

00:08:25.904 --> 00:08:27.265
a ritual site somewhere here.

00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:29.344
You're just making this up.

00:08:29.664 --> 00:08:31.185
Your imagination runs wild.

00:08:32.105 --> 00:08:33.465
Quite the storyteller.

00:08:34.664 --> 00:08:36.745
Young Third Master,
you're tricking us again.

00:08:38.865 --> 00:08:39.824
What's the truth, then?

00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:41.544
Third Uncle didn't find the truth.

00:08:41.544 --> 00:08:42.784
So he said I made it up.

00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:43.985
Impossible.

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:45.985
You don't know him well enough.

00:08:55.865 --> 00:08:56.664
Pan Zi.

00:09:00.944 --> 00:09:01.664
Look.

00:09:01.664 --> 00:09:02.745
What does this look like?

00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:03.784
One,

00:09:03.904 --> 00:09:04.505
two,

00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:05.265
three,

00:09:05.265 --> 00:09:08.025
four, five, six, seven.

00:09:08.784 --> 00:09:09.944
The Big Dipper.

00:09:10.145 --> 00:09:10.904
Right?

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.745
This position marks the Dipper.

00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:16.304
Its tail.

00:09:16.304 --> 00:09:17.105
Right?

00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:25.465
What's facing the entrance

00:09:25.704 --> 00:09:26.865
is the North Star.

00:09:26.985 --> 00:09:27.745
Right?

00:09:27.745 --> 00:09:28.544
Third Uncle,

00:09:29.544 --> 00:09:31.784
the Big Dipper's handle
points the other way.

00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:33.824
It points to north now.

00:09:34.064 --> 00:09:35.985
Does it carry some hidden meaning?

00:09:38.505 --> 00:09:39.265
Third Master,

00:09:39.265 --> 00:09:40.784
there's something in this tree hollow.

00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:41.944
What?

00:09:45.704 --> 00:09:46.544
Look.

00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:51.424
A mummy?

00:09:55.184 --> 00:09:56.745
How did it get inside?

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:02.265
Did it fall into the tree's

00:10:02.265 --> 00:10:03.584
hollow interior?

00:10:04.745 --> 00:10:06.985
Or was it dragged in by something?

00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:09.225
Third Master,

00:10:10.385 --> 00:10:12.424
look at the equipment on this mummy.

00:10:13.064 --> 00:10:13.704
Could this be

00:10:13.704 --> 00:10:15.664
one of the missing people
from the tents?

00:10:19.345 --> 00:10:20.304
Likely.

00:10:20.368 --> 00:10:21.904
It's been here for four or five years.

00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:23.025
The time matches.

00:10:23.745 --> 00:10:25.664
Could he be someone from Ma's team?

00:10:25.664 --> 00:10:27.225
But why a foreigner?

00:10:28.904 --> 00:10:29.704
Let me see.

00:10:31.304 --> 00:10:32.944
Pan Zi. Pan Zi.

00:10:34.544 --> 00:10:35.385
Don't touch it.

00:10:37.424 --> 00:10:39.145
This person died here accidentally.

00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:40.345
It's not safe here.

00:10:40.664 --> 00:10:41.385
Break's over.

00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:42.345
Find an exit now.

00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:46.105
There's a chamber on each side.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:47.625
Da Kui,

00:10:47.824 --> 00:10:49.345
let's scout ahead.

00:10:49.824 --> 00:10:50.345
Pan Zi,

00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:51.424
you stay here.

00:10:51.865 --> 00:10:53.225
Watch what Xiaoge does.

00:10:53.225 --> 00:10:54.544
Don't let him wander off.

00:10:54.944 --> 00:10:55.704
Got it.

00:11:00.584 --> 00:11:01.745
Give me some water.

00:11:01.944 --> 00:11:02.704
It's in the bag.

00:11:06.944 --> 00:11:07.704
Pan Zi,

00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:09.345
I've got a wild theory.

00:11:09.824 --> 00:11:11.544
Could the 'Seven' on the stone carving

00:11:11.944 --> 00:11:12.904
not be an entity?

00:11:12.904 --> 00:11:13.784
Where's the water?

00:11:13.784 --> 00:11:15.025
Look, seven alchemy furnaces.

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:16.625
Maybe seven monsters

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:17.904
are guarding King Shang of Lu.

00:11:18.704 --> 00:11:20.145
Third Master was right.

00:11:20.145 --> 00:11:22.064
Your imagination's too wild.

00:11:22.544 --> 00:11:23.304
What's wrong?

00:11:31.704 --> 00:11:32.505
What's wrong?

00:11:33.265 --> 00:11:34.664
It moved.

00:11:36.145 --> 00:11:36.944
It did?

00:11:54.345 --> 00:11:55.105
Third Master.

00:11:56.105 --> 00:11:56.904
Third Master.

00:11:57.225 --> 00:11:58.544
There's a bag hanging up here.

00:11:58.544 --> 00:11:59.745
Could it belong to Ma's team?

00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:05.064
Da Kui?

00:12:07.704 --> 00:12:08.465
Da Kui?

00:12:09.824 --> 00:12:10.784
Third Master!

00:12:11.745 --> 00:12:12.584
I'm down here!

00:12:12.584 --> 00:12:14.544
Da Kui, you triggered a trap.

00:12:14.944 --> 00:12:16.944
You're not full of arrows, are you?

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:17.784
I'm fine.

00:12:26.544 --> 00:12:27.505
It didn't move.

00:13:07.265 --> 00:13:08.105
Young Third Master,

00:13:08.664 --> 00:13:10.544
there's another person back here.

00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:22.304
Don't touch him.

00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:23.544
The real deal is behind him.

00:13:32.784 --> 00:13:34.064
What is this thing?

00:13:34.345 --> 00:13:35.985
Could it be the second monster?

00:13:36.784 --> 00:13:38.944
It's so dried up
that it's barely recognizable.

00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:40.904
Third Master said not to touch them.

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:41.985
And we'll be fine.

00:13:43.025 --> 00:13:44.345
Let's retreat slowly.

00:13:47.865 --> 00:13:49.505
There are seven monsters in here.

00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:51.505
This one contains one of them.

00:13:52.584 --> 00:13:54.105
What's inside the other six?

00:13:56.265 --> 00:13:56.985
Pan Zi...

00:13:59.664 --> 00:14:00.704
Third Uncle?

00:14:01.944 --> 00:14:02.745
Da Kui?

00:14:04.784 --> 00:14:05.465
No.

00:14:05.784 --> 00:14:06.824
It's not them.

00:14:13.465 --> 00:14:15.184
Have all these monsters come out?

00:14:56.465 --> 00:14:57.424
It's for fun.

00:14:57.424 --> 00:14:58.265
No need to shoot me.

00:14:58.265 --> 00:14:59.745
No. He's heading to the kiln.

00:14:59.904 --> 00:15:01.105
Don't let him touch the kiln.

00:15:01.304 --> 00:15:02.414
Wait here for Third Master.

00:15:03.544 --> 00:15:04.385
Pan Zi!

00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:21.584
Third Uncle?

00:15:21.784 --> 00:15:22.704
Da Kui?

00:15:27.544 --> 00:15:28.304
Where is everyone?

00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:29.345
Third Uncle?

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:30.184
Da Kui?

00:15:30.584 --> 00:15:32.184
Stop it. Where are you?

00:15:32.544 --> 00:15:33.424
They're gone.

00:15:33.704 --> 00:15:34.745
Third Uncle's gone.

00:17:37.624 --> 00:17:38.465
Pan Zi?

00:17:39.945 --> 00:17:40.824
Is that you?

00:17:44.584 --> 00:17:45.425
Pan Zi?

00:19:04.624 --> 00:19:05.465
I'm sorry.

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:11.665
This kid can really run.

00:21:27.864 --> 00:21:29.784
Throwing stuff is crossing the line.

00:21:31.185 --> 00:21:32.665
That could kill someone.

00:21:35.706 --> 00:21:37.465
Think you're special
because you're handsome?

00:21:38.265 --> 00:21:39.945
Quit showing off.

00:21:41.225 --> 00:21:42.304
Want a fight?

00:21:42.584 --> 00:21:43.344
Bring it on.

00:21:43.505 --> 00:21:44.505
I will fight with you.

00:21:51.945 --> 00:21:52.624
Come at me!

00:21:53.384 --> 00:21:54.225
I'll make you a stew.

00:21:54.225 --> 00:21:55.185
You know?

00:21:56.225 --> 00:21:56.824
Come on.

00:21:56.824 --> 00:21:57.705
Don't freeze up.

00:21:57.864 --> 00:21:58.864
Scared, aren't you?

00:21:58.864 --> 00:21:59.705
Come on.

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:01.144
Frozen?

00:22:01.465 --> 00:22:02.384
Now you're scared?

00:22:05.064 --> 00:22:06.144
Got backup, huh?

00:22:42.665 --> 00:22:43.824
Why is it so long?

00:23:11.304 --> 00:23:12.384
Forget it. I'll keep going.

00:23:23.265 --> 00:23:24.465
Not there yet?

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:54.185
Another one?

00:24:28.104 --> 00:24:28.985
Da Kui?

00:24:29.784 --> 00:24:30.705
Third Master,

00:24:30.864 --> 00:24:32.144
I'm on the left.

00:24:34.985 --> 00:24:35.985
Left side?

00:24:35.985 --> 00:24:37.905
I'm on the right.

00:24:39.905 --> 00:24:40.985
I'm on the left.

00:24:41.144 --> 00:24:42.584
Come towards me, Da Kui.

00:24:44.425 --> 00:24:46.025
Don't go right.

00:24:47.064 --> 00:24:48.745
Don't go right!

00:24:53.544 --> 00:24:54.584
Third Master.

00:24:57.505 --> 00:24:58.465
Come here.

00:25:05.864 --> 00:25:06.824
Left side.

00:25:12.465 --> 00:25:13.465
Third Master?

00:25:16.905 --> 00:25:17.905
Not the left.

00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:21.584
Third Master?

00:25:22.745 --> 00:25:23.665
Third Master?

00:25:25.705 --> 00:25:26.505
Da Kui?

00:25:28.384 --> 00:25:29.344
Third Master?

00:25:36.945 --> 00:25:39.384
Da Kui, stay where you are.

00:25:39.384 --> 00:25:40.584
And don't speak.

00:25:40.584 --> 00:25:41.945
The echo here is strong.

00:25:41.945 --> 00:25:43.465
More talking means more confusion.

00:25:44.705 --> 00:25:45.665
Shout once.

00:25:49.225 --> 00:25:50.025
Again.

00:25:55.505 --> 00:25:56.304
Third Master,

00:25:56.505 --> 00:25:57.985
are you shining this light?

00:25:58.465 --> 00:25:59.185
Yes.

00:25:59.985 --> 00:26:00.905
Come here.

00:26:01.265 --> 00:26:03.185
Okay, Third Master. Slow down.

00:26:03.624 --> 00:26:04.584
Slow down.

00:26:12.544 --> 00:26:15.025
The sound directions here are all wrong.

00:26:15.665 --> 00:26:17.225
What kind of place is this?

00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:18.624
Third Master,

00:26:18.864 --> 00:26:20.425
so you were pushed down here?

00:26:20.425 --> 00:26:22.064
Did you see what it was?

00:26:22.185 --> 00:26:22.985
No.

00:26:23.144 --> 00:26:24.584
This place is weird.

00:26:24.745 --> 00:26:25.584
I feel a lot

00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:27.584
of strange things
will happen here very soon.

00:26:28.025 --> 00:26:29.465
Let's regroup with the others.

00:26:44.945 --> 00:26:48.185
Who would install a door
opening downward?

00:26:55.584 --> 00:26:56.584
My back.

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:08.665
(Another corpse.)

00:28:36.064 --> 00:28:37.864
Let me cover you up, buddy.

00:28:41.225 --> 00:28:44.544
022, 00059?

00:28:53.904 --> 00:28:58.256
(Storage ticket)

00:29:03.864 --> 00:29:04.945
If given the chance,

00:29:05.864 --> 00:29:08.185
I'll give this to your family.

00:29:12.864 --> 00:29:14.544
What is this place?

00:29:15.384 --> 00:29:16.304
A maze?

00:29:17.144 --> 00:29:18.584
Where does the path lead?

00:29:18.945 --> 00:29:20.945
We're going around in circles.

00:29:27.624 --> 00:29:28.544
Not working either.

00:29:29.784 --> 00:29:31.064
Seems like another dead end.

00:29:36.344 --> 00:29:37.425
Da Kui, look.

00:29:38.864 --> 00:29:40.265
Someone's been here.

00:29:43.425 --> 00:29:44.185
Look.

00:29:45.905 --> 00:29:47.745
They left in a hurry.

00:29:49.304 --> 00:29:50.064
Exactly.

00:29:50.665 --> 00:29:52.104
They took one bite of a biscuit

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:53.864
and left the bottle cap open.

00:29:54.665 --> 00:29:56.225
Why did they leave in such a rush?

00:29:57.465 --> 00:29:59.025
Something dragged them?

00:30:01.064 --> 00:30:01.985
Third Master.

00:30:05.985 --> 00:30:07.344
Isn't this Ma?

00:30:07.344 --> 00:30:08.225
It's him.

00:30:08.304 --> 00:30:09.304
We're on the right track.

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:14.304
Ma came with a whole team.

00:30:16.465 --> 00:30:17.945
Dozens of people were in the team.

00:30:19.864 --> 00:30:21.425
Why is there only one person left now?

00:30:21.905 --> 00:30:23.344
Where did all the others go?

00:30:23.505 --> 00:30:24.864
And they left in such a hurry.

00:30:27.945 --> 00:30:30.025
Looks like something took him away.

00:30:31.905 --> 00:30:32.784
Third Master.

00:30:33.745 --> 00:30:34.544
Gunpowder?

00:30:34.544 --> 00:30:35.864
Why would he carry these?

00:30:36.384 --> 00:30:37.784
Ma's an amateur.

00:30:37.985 --> 00:30:39.505
Amateurs always go for such stuff.

00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:49.584
The fog's getting thicker here.

00:30:52.624 --> 00:30:54.705
It might be another defensive mechanism.

00:31:47.265 --> 00:31:48.025
Young Third Master!

00:31:48.185 --> 00:31:49.025
Pan Zi!

00:32:00.784 --> 00:32:01.584
Don't move!

00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:02.945
Put your hands down.

00:32:09.185 --> 00:32:09.985
Come up!

00:32:23.104 --> 00:32:24.665
Run! Hurry!

00:32:25.144 --> 00:32:25.905
Get back here!

00:32:36.528 --> 00:32:37.624
Why isn't it lighting up?

00:32:56.225 --> 00:32:57.144
Handsome! Handsome!

00:32:57.864 --> 00:32:58.544
Handsome!

00:33:00.528 --> 00:33:01.425
The thing earlier...

00:33:02.185 --> 00:33:02.945
The...

00:33:08.304 --> 00:33:08.864
Wait.

00:33:09.384 --> 00:33:10.465
What the heck is that?

00:34:13.184 --> 00:34:14.345
What's this, Third Master?

00:34:28.704 --> 00:34:29.544
Young Third Master!

00:34:29.825 --> 00:34:30.704
Young Third Master!

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:31.865
Da Kui.

00:34:36.385 --> 00:34:37.385
What are you doing?

00:34:38.345 --> 00:34:39.584
Something there is blocking us.

00:34:39.785 --> 00:34:40.985
It even pulled me.

00:34:41.465 --> 00:34:42.664
A monster is there too.

00:34:43.184 --> 00:34:44.785
You mentioned seven monsters.

00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:01.144
What are these?

00:35:02.264 --> 00:35:03.305
They are big!

00:35:04.785 --> 00:35:05.985
Isn't he that fat guy?

00:35:06.785 --> 00:35:08.544
He's the one Xiaoge and I were chasing.

00:35:09.825 --> 00:35:10.505
Who are you?

00:35:10.744 --> 00:35:12.584
Who are you? I should be asking you!

00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:16.505
Bro,

00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:17.224
get me up first,

00:35:17.224 --> 00:35:18.305
and I'll tell you who I am.

00:35:18.305 --> 00:35:18.985
Right.

00:35:20.345 --> 00:35:22.465
You're saving him
without even knowing who he is?

00:35:25.664 --> 00:35:27.385
Help me, please!

00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:30.425
Let's help him first.

00:35:30.425 --> 00:35:31.865
We can outnumber him.

00:35:32.184 --> 00:35:33.104
Grab me.

00:35:33.425 --> 00:35:34.505
You're the best.

00:35:34.505 --> 00:35:35.785
Give me a hand. Thanks.

00:35:35.785 --> 00:35:36.544
Come on.

00:35:40.345 --> 00:35:41.104
Young Third Master!

00:35:49.945 --> 00:35:51.664
Young Third Master, get up here.

00:36:00.385 --> 00:36:01.584
