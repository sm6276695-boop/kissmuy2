00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:06.817
What's going on?

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:15.738
Thank you.

00:02:15.738 --> 00:02:17.738
This snake is the incarnation
of Mountain God.

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:19.618
You shouldn't have killed it.

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:20.697
You've caused trouble.

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:22.537
Bury it quickly.

00:02:22.857 --> 00:02:23.938
Hurry up.

00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:25.458
Or it will take revenge on us.

00:02:26.137 --> 00:02:27.417
That's superstitious nonsense.

00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:30.018
Right, right.

00:02:30.577 --> 00:02:31.657
We'll do that.

00:02:31.977 --> 00:02:32.778
Go bury it.

00:02:33.218 --> 00:02:34.018
Da Kui,

00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:35.738
wherever we go,

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:37.338
we must respect local customs.

00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:39.257
It's not superstition, but respect.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:40.458
Go bury it now.

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:41.817
Okay.

00:02:43.778 --> 00:02:44.977
Come on, Yang.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.298
Carry Mountain God, follow me.

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:55.938
Let me brief the situation.

00:02:56.498 --> 00:02:57.778
This place should be

00:02:57.778 --> 00:02:59.458
Ma's team's campsite.

00:03:00.738 --> 00:03:02.458
The only uncertainty now is

00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:04.537
whether Ma had the accident here

00:03:04.537 --> 00:03:06.137
or at the location marked on the map.

00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:11.218
But since he camped here,

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:14.218
that place can't be far from here.

00:03:14.857 --> 00:03:16.338
How long have we walked?

00:03:18.137 --> 00:03:20.178
We've reached the marked area
on Mount Shending.

00:03:36.218 --> 00:03:36.817
Right.

00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:39.938
Ma must be nearby.

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:41.938
Take a break first. Set up the fire.

00:03:42.058 --> 00:03:43.377
We'll search for Ma after eating.

00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:48.257
We didn't mean to offend.

00:03:48.577 --> 00:03:49.458
Please forgive us.

00:03:49.898 --> 00:03:51.298
Keep us safe.

00:03:56.857 --> 00:03:58.417
Keep us safe. Keep us safe.

00:04:18.377 --> 00:04:19.137
Third Master.

00:04:20.938 --> 00:04:21.777
The soil...

00:04:22.618 --> 00:04:23.897
There's blood in the soil.

00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:25.498
Was Ma killed by someone

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:26.377
and buried here?

00:04:28.098 --> 00:04:29.498
It contains cinnabar.

00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:31.457
It's getting complicated.

00:04:31.658 --> 00:04:34.017
Third Uncle,
it's like Grandpa's notes said.

00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:37.337
Shut up.

00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:41.697
Fill it back now. Hurry.

00:04:47.377 --> 00:04:49.137
Third Master! Third Master!

00:04:55.538 --> 00:04:56.418
Alright.

00:04:57.618 --> 00:04:59.137
Listen. I hereby declare

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:00.618
this operation of ours

00:05:00.858 --> 00:05:03.058
ends here. It's over.

00:05:03.058 --> 00:05:03.897
Don't ask me why.

00:05:03.897 --> 00:05:05.217
I won't explain it to you.

00:05:05.217 --> 00:05:06.337
Get out of here now.

00:05:06.337 --> 00:05:07.217
You hear me? Let's go.

00:05:07.217 --> 00:05:08.938
If we can't find him, the Mas won't pay.

00:05:09.697 --> 00:05:13.058
Da Kui, jobs require being alive
to do them.

00:05:13.257 --> 00:05:14.058
Understand?

00:05:14.178 --> 00:05:16.017
We can't handle what's here.

00:05:16.217 --> 00:05:18.098
Let's go. There are plenty
of jobs elsewhere.

00:05:30.738 --> 00:05:31.697
Lv Dandan?

00:05:34.377 --> 00:05:35.178
Lv Dandan?

00:05:37.098 --> 00:05:38.618
This place is shady.

00:05:38.897 --> 00:05:40.418
Everyone, search the area.

00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:41.538
Look for any traces of Ma.

00:05:41.538 --> 00:05:43.058
We must leave before dark.

00:05:45.938 --> 00:05:46.577
Da Kui.

00:05:46.938 --> 00:05:47.897
We'll search for Ma.

00:05:48.418 --> 00:05:49.658
You bring Yang back.

00:05:53.897 --> 00:05:55.897
How about we go together?

00:06:02.377 --> 00:06:03.178
Dandan?

00:06:06.538 --> 00:06:07.298
Dandan?

00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:24.577
Yang!

00:06:33.377 --> 00:06:34.377
Dandan?

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.098
Dandan?

00:06:46.897 --> 00:06:47.938
Help!

00:06:48.058 --> 00:06:49.098
Help!

00:06:59.938 --> 00:07:00.817
Hold on!

00:07:01.577 --> 00:07:02.377
Help!

00:07:04.058 --> 00:07:05.178
What's that?

00:07:14.337 --> 00:07:15.298
Young Third Master!

00:07:21.377 --> 00:07:22.337
Help!

00:07:24.978 --> 00:07:25.938
Help!

00:07:27.577 --> 00:07:28.457
Young Third Master!

00:07:28.457 --> 00:07:29.817
What's that thing? It's so strong!

00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:30.577
A snake!

00:07:30.577 --> 00:07:31.858
Looks like a snake.

00:07:32.017 --> 00:07:32.858
Let go!

00:07:33.058 --> 00:07:34.618
Let go, or we'll all fall!

00:07:35.457 --> 00:07:36.577
Hold on!

00:07:40.858 --> 00:07:42.098
I can't hold on!

00:08:20.938 --> 00:08:21.697
Don't let go!

00:08:21.697 --> 00:08:22.538
I won't.

00:08:23.817 --> 00:08:24.897
Don't let go!

00:08:27.658 --> 00:08:28.498
Third Uncle,

00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:29.817
there's a slope below.

00:08:29.817 --> 00:08:30.817
It won't be fatal.

00:08:30.938 --> 00:08:31.777
Xiaoge,

00:08:32.097 --> 00:08:33.538
let go and go down to fight!

00:08:43.138 --> 00:08:44.977
Xiaoge, let go!

00:09:11.898 --> 00:09:13.418
Third Master, I'm stuck.

00:09:20.898 --> 00:09:21.658
You okay?

00:09:21.658 --> 00:09:22.457
I'm fine.

00:09:22.577 --> 00:09:23.378
What's wrong?

00:09:26.018 --> 00:09:26.778
Pan Zi!

00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:28.658
What're you doing?

00:09:29.817 --> 00:09:30.697
Da Kui,

00:09:31.497 --> 00:09:33.217
do you ever wash your feet?

00:09:33.617 --> 00:09:35.258
I'm crushed, Young Third Master.

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:36.737
Help me.

00:09:38.097 --> 00:09:39.058
Young Third Master.

00:09:39.418 --> 00:09:40.817
Hurry, we're stuck here.

00:09:41.258 --> 00:09:42.658
I can't move.

00:09:43.778 --> 00:09:45.138
I'm stuck. Over here.

00:09:45.857 --> 00:09:46.577
Coming.

00:09:46.577 --> 00:09:47.337
Coming.

00:09:47.856 --> 00:09:48.778
Will this side work?

00:09:48.778 --> 00:09:49.737
You need to pull Da Kui.

00:09:49.857 --> 00:09:50.178
Got it.

00:09:50.178 --> 00:09:51.497
Wait a second.

00:09:51.497 --> 00:09:52.337
Let me push.

00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:53.178
Up!

00:09:57.817 --> 00:09:58.778
Help Third Uncle.

00:10:00.258 --> 00:10:00.697
Come on.

00:10:00.697 --> 00:10:02.418
Alright, alright.

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:03.898
Where's Xiaoge?

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:06.977
Snake. Snake.

00:10:07.418 --> 00:10:08.298
It was a snake.

00:10:08.938 --> 00:10:09.617
Xiaoge?

00:10:10.217 --> 00:10:10.898
Here.

00:10:10.898 --> 00:10:11.497
Xiaoge,

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:13.258
did you drive the snake away?

00:10:17.337 --> 00:10:18.097
Old man,

00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:19.058
stop playing dead.

00:10:19.217 --> 00:10:20.977
Thank you. Thank you all for saving me.

00:10:20.977 --> 00:10:22.337
I didn't. I saved him.

00:10:22.337 --> 00:10:23.178
Old man!

00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:25.497
What exactly happened earlier?

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:26.337
A snake...

00:10:26.457 --> 00:10:27.178
No, not a snake.

00:10:27.178 --> 00:10:28.298
A snake-like monster

00:10:28.298 --> 00:10:29.217
dragged me in.

00:10:29.217 --> 00:10:31.298
What snake-like monster? Make it clear.

00:10:31.817 --> 00:10:33.018
I... I didn't see clearly.

00:10:33.138 --> 00:10:34.178
It wrapped around me

00:10:34.178 --> 00:10:35.178
and dragged me down.

00:10:35.178 --> 00:10:36.337
Stop lying.

00:10:36.337 --> 00:10:37.617
I'm not. Ask the young master.

00:10:37.617 --> 00:10:38.577
You saw it?

00:10:38.857 --> 00:10:40.138
Too dark. I didn't see clearly.

00:10:40.138 --> 00:10:41.577
I saw something snake-like

00:10:41.577 --> 00:10:42.737
grab us.

00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:45.737
It shouldn't be a snake.

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:47.898
A snake that size
wouldn't have such strength.

00:10:48.737 --> 00:10:50.138
But why did it drag us in?

00:10:51.337 --> 00:10:52.778
And it disappeared after that.

00:10:53.097 --> 00:10:54.658
Snake monster. Must be a snake monster.

00:10:54.658 --> 00:10:56.178
They must want to eat us.

00:10:56.697 --> 00:10:58.497
Enough. Stop it.

00:10:58.697 --> 00:11:00.378
Whatever dragged us down here,

00:11:00.378 --> 00:11:01.617
we need to leave quickly.

00:11:02.097 --> 00:11:02.817
Wu Xie,

00:11:03.298 --> 00:11:04.258
climb up and see

00:11:04.258 --> 00:11:05.497
if we can go back the same way.

00:11:05.857 --> 00:11:06.938
Hurry and go.

00:11:06.938 --> 00:11:07.737
Wait.

00:11:09.977 --> 00:11:10.857
I'll go.

00:11:12.817 --> 00:11:13.577
Be careful.

00:11:31.217 --> 00:11:32.898
Run! Run now!

00:11:33.538 --> 00:11:34.538
Stop yelling!

00:11:36.337 --> 00:11:37.097
You okay?

00:11:43.217 --> 00:11:44.337
It seems blocked.

00:11:45.018 --> 00:11:47.178
Seems heaven doesn't want us going back.

00:11:50.097 --> 00:11:50.898
Xiaoge,

00:11:51.298 --> 00:11:52.577
scout ahead.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:58.058
Get up.

00:11:58.138 --> 00:11:58.817
Get up.

00:11:59.457 --> 00:12:00.217
Get up.

00:12:02.418 --> 00:12:03.258
I'm up.

00:12:03.538 --> 00:12:04.337
Let's go.

00:12:04.737 --> 00:12:06.418
The way back is blocked. Let's proceed.

00:12:07.097 --> 00:12:08.378
What? After me.

00:12:08.538 --> 00:12:09.337
Let's go.

00:12:15.857 --> 00:12:16.538
Hurry.

00:12:17.658 --> 00:12:18.457
Move.

00:12:18.457 --> 00:12:19.617
Okay.

00:13:02.778 --> 00:13:03.497
Third Uncle,

00:13:03.778 --> 00:13:05.138
why's there a door here?

00:13:14.697 --> 00:13:15.538
Pan Zi.

00:13:18.258 --> 00:13:19.938
Wait. Hold on.

00:13:20.778 --> 00:13:21.697
This location

00:13:23.617 --> 00:13:25.258
is right below the campsite.

00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:34.658
So this is the real place
marked by the map.

00:13:40.817 --> 00:13:45.138
Look. Behind this wall

00:13:45.737 --> 00:13:47.577
is where we found the bloody soil.

00:13:49.018 --> 00:13:50.178
Ma and his team

00:13:50.178 --> 00:13:51.617
probably discovered this place

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:53.577
and then disappeared.

00:13:54.577 --> 00:13:56.217
This place is very dangerous.

00:14:00.857 --> 00:14:02.497
But now the way back is blocked.

00:14:02.497 --> 00:14:04.097
I'm not sure if we should go in or not.

00:14:06.938 --> 00:14:08.097
Let's vote.

00:14:12.378 --> 00:14:13.697
Then let's go in.

00:14:14.097 --> 00:14:15.418
I'll smash the wall first.

00:14:15.658 --> 00:14:17.298
We can't just wait here to die.

00:14:19.018 --> 00:14:20.097
Don't touch anything.

00:14:47.217 --> 00:14:48.298
There's a trap here.

00:14:51.178 --> 00:14:53.097
It's full of alum acid
used for alchemy inside.

00:14:54.737 --> 00:14:55.697
Once broken,

00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:57.977
we'll be burned to death
by the acid immediately.

00:15:02.298 --> 00:15:03.817
Then what should we do?

00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:21.018
I've dug the well as you instructed.

00:15:23.217 --> 00:15:24.058
You...

00:15:29.457 --> 00:15:30.178
Fire.

00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:32.058
I've got it.

00:15:40.018 --> 00:15:41.217
Too much pressure in the wall.

00:15:41.778 --> 00:15:43.298
I need to start from the middle.

00:16:08.658 --> 00:16:09.457
Remember,

00:16:09.778 --> 00:16:10.938
this is an ancient site.

00:16:11.617 --> 00:16:13.378
There might be cultural relics inside.

00:16:13.778 --> 00:16:15.857
Be careful not to touch anything.

00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:18.378
Third Uncle,

00:16:18.497 --> 00:16:19.857
why is he so good?

00:16:20.258 --> 00:16:21.817
How did he find the trap in the wall?

00:16:22.018 --> 00:16:24.258
And he pried out the bricks bare-handed.

00:16:24.378 --> 00:16:25.737
That wall was seamless.

00:16:25.857 --> 00:16:26.778
How did he manage that?

00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:27.938
You have too many questions.

00:16:27.938 --> 00:16:29.817
The world is full
of extraordinary people.

00:16:30.058 --> 00:16:31.977
Don't probe. That's the rule.

00:16:32.457 --> 00:16:33.217
Okay.

00:16:46.097 --> 00:16:48.697
Third Master,
all gaps have been blocked.

00:16:48.697 --> 00:16:49.457
There's no way out.

00:16:49.617 --> 00:16:51.337
And I didn't find anything snake-like.

00:16:51.497 --> 00:16:52.577
How's it going here?

00:16:52.737 --> 00:16:53.817
The timed countdown is up.

00:16:56.337 --> 00:16:57.058
Wu Xie.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:16:59.697
Wu Xie.

00:17:01.457 --> 00:17:02.418
Wu Xie.

00:17:03.938 --> 00:17:05.938
Time's up. Go get Xiaoge.

00:17:07.418 --> 00:17:09.457
If you can't figure it out,
stop dwelling on it.

00:17:17.257 --> 00:17:18.098
Xiaoge,

00:17:18.977 --> 00:17:20.017
time's up.

00:17:30.777 --> 00:17:31.658
It's done.

00:17:31.977 --> 00:17:33.578
Third Uncle, it's done.

00:17:34.017 --> 00:17:35.537
Okay. Da Kui.

00:17:38.217 --> 00:17:38.578
What?

00:17:38.578 --> 00:17:39.338
Get to work.

00:17:39.938 --> 00:17:40.737
What work?

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:41.777
Smash the wall.

00:17:43.537 --> 00:17:44.658
So I can smash it now?

00:17:44.658 --> 00:17:45.457
Yes.

00:17:49.017 --> 00:17:49.737
Third Master,

00:17:50.777 --> 00:17:52.138
that guy's suspicious.

00:17:53.017 --> 00:17:54.257
He knows everything.

00:17:54.257 --> 00:17:55.457
Is he trustworthy?

00:17:55.618 --> 00:17:57.618
At least we're safer with him around.

00:17:57.737 --> 00:17:59.858
Let's focus on finding a way out first.

00:18:17.057 --> 00:18:17.858
Third Master.

00:18:51.537 --> 00:18:52.737
What kind of place is this?

00:18:54.017 --> 00:18:56.217
It should be a kiln.

00:18:56.217 --> 00:18:57.017
A kiln?

00:18:58.457 --> 00:18:59.977
What kind of kiln is this?

00:19:01.537 --> 00:19:03.138
It looks like

00:19:03.858 --> 00:19:05.537
an ancient porcelain-firing kiln.

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:06.898
After searching so long,

00:19:06.898 --> 00:19:08.658
the map has led us to a kiln?

00:19:08.658 --> 00:19:09.737
But why build a kiln

00:19:09.737 --> 00:19:11.418
deep in the mountains like this?

00:19:12.658 --> 00:19:14.418
Porcelain easily chips during transport.

00:19:14.418 --> 00:19:16.338
How could they move products from here?

00:19:16.818 --> 00:19:17.457
And they set up

00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:19.217
that dangerous alum acid wall outside.

00:19:19.418 --> 00:19:20.977
Clearly they wanted to keep people out.

00:19:21.178 --> 00:19:21.977
Third Uncle,

00:19:22.297 --> 00:19:23.418
I don't think this place

00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:25.217
is just a regular kiln.

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:27.497
Can you learn to shut up?

00:19:58.858 --> 00:19:59.658
Third Master.

00:20:07.858 --> 00:20:09.858
This should be a sacrificial cauldron.

00:20:09.977 --> 00:20:10.938
A sacrificial cauldron?

00:20:14.418 --> 00:20:15.497
I get it.

00:20:16.418 --> 00:20:17.338
I get it.

00:20:17.497 --> 00:20:18.418
I've heard

00:20:18.938 --> 00:20:20.618
during sacrifices, the ancients

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:23.098
liked cutting off prisoners' heads

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:24.017
to honor heaven first

00:20:24.737 --> 00:20:26.497
and then using the bodies to honor men.

00:20:26.818 --> 00:20:28.737
Why would there be prisoners in a kiln?

00:20:29.697 --> 00:20:31.017
Indeed. That's unlikely.

00:20:31.457 --> 00:20:33.697
So these people
probably weren't prisoners.

00:20:34.658 --> 00:20:35.818
Could they be craftsmen?

00:20:36.057 --> 00:20:38.297
I've only heard
of sacrificing swordsmiths to swords.

00:20:38.418 --> 00:20:40.017
But sacrificing for porcelain?

00:20:40.017 --> 00:20:41.257
That's exaggerated.

00:20:41.418 --> 00:20:42.138
I understand now.

00:20:42.138 --> 00:20:44.378
Those hundred turtle shells
make sense now.

00:20:44.378 --> 00:20:46.017
They were just a smokescreen.

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:48.297
All those strange legends
about Mount Shending

00:20:48.297 --> 00:20:50.537
were created
to hide this kiln's existence.

00:20:51.537 --> 00:20:53.217
Who could have built this kiln?

00:20:53.217 --> 00:20:55.217
We can't figure it out by just staring.

00:20:55.217 --> 00:20:57.017
Let me search for clues here.

00:20:57.017 --> 00:20:58.737
Pan Zi, what are you doing?

00:21:01.178 --> 00:21:02.098
Third Master,

00:21:02.658 --> 00:21:04.418
his clothing looks strange.

00:21:04.418 --> 00:21:06.057
I want to confirm his identity.

00:21:11.057 --> 00:21:12.378
Don't use your hand.

00:21:15.017 --> 00:21:16.217
It's not a human.

00:21:16.217 --> 00:21:17.418
It's a human-shaped figure.

00:21:17.418 --> 00:21:18.697
And it's made of clay.

00:21:24.898 --> 00:21:26.578
I think I know what this place is.

00:21:27.338 --> 00:21:29.578
It might not be a porcelain kiln at all.

00:21:30.098 --> 00:21:32.578
It might be a kiln
for firing human-shaped figures.

00:21:33.098 --> 00:21:34.378
Why make human-shaped figures?

00:21:34.618 --> 00:21:35.497
Why?

00:21:35.858 --> 00:21:37.257
You know the Terracotta Army?

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.257
They used
live human sacrifices at first.

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:41.898
But it was too cruel,

00:21:41.898 --> 00:21:44.017
so later they replaced them
with human-shaped figures.

00:21:44.017 --> 00:21:46.338
Craftsmen would follow
exact human proportions,

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:48.057
even replicating facial features

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:49.578
with perfect accuracy.

00:21:49.737 --> 00:21:53.017
These clay figures would then

00:21:53.017 --> 00:21:54.697
be fired inside the kiln

00:21:54.697 --> 00:21:56.618
until becoming permanent statues.

00:22:02.378 --> 00:22:03.257
My theory is

00:22:05.098 --> 00:22:06.818
this place must be

00:22:07.017 --> 00:22:09.297
a dedicated kiln
for human-shaped figures.

00:22:09.297 --> 00:22:10.618
This kiln's been fired before,

00:22:10.858 --> 00:22:11.818
and it's still sealed.

00:22:11.818 --> 00:22:12.938
Meaning there's likely

00:22:12.938 --> 00:22:14.578
a completed figure inside.

00:22:15.658 --> 00:22:16.378
Third Master,

00:22:17.138 --> 00:22:18.297
am I correct?

00:22:18.858 --> 00:22:20.138
This is too far-fetched.

00:22:23.858 --> 00:22:25.858
This is just an ancient kiln.

00:22:27.418 --> 00:22:28.938
Ancient kilns have their own dangers.

00:22:31.057 --> 00:22:32.858
Reach deeper with your hands.

00:22:38.138 --> 00:22:39.777
We're here to find an exit,

00:22:40.378 --> 00:22:41.777
not solve puzzles.

00:22:42.457 --> 00:22:43.977
Puzzle-lovers can stay.

00:22:45.217 --> 00:22:47.217
Those seeking people, follow me out.

00:22:47.898 --> 00:22:49.737
You love puzzles. You stay then.

00:22:50.977 --> 00:22:52.178
Everyone, stay alert.

00:23:02.658 --> 00:23:03.537
What was that sound?

00:23:13.017 --> 00:23:14.257
Could they have burned

00:23:14.257 --> 00:23:15.777
living people inside these kilns?

00:23:16.017 --> 00:23:17.697
The unavenged dead are seeking justice?

00:23:17.697 --> 00:23:18.697
Monsters!

00:23:20.257 --> 00:23:21.378
Stay here and don't move.

00:23:21.737 --> 00:23:23.297
Don't move.

00:24:32.818 --> 00:24:34.057
What's he doing?

00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:36.338
What's he doing?

00:24:37.178 --> 00:24:39.378
He seems to be negotiating
with something inside.

00:24:40.217 --> 00:24:41.297
He's testing whether

00:24:41.297 --> 00:24:43.178
dangerous parasites are present.

00:24:44.457 --> 00:24:45.818
Must he kneel to listen?

00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:47.338
It's an insect catcher's tradition.

00:24:52.618 --> 00:24:54.297
Don't touch anything here.

00:24:55.017 --> 00:24:56.418
What's inside is powerful.

00:24:56.858 --> 00:24:58.138
If we release it,

00:24:58.977 --> 00:25:00.818
not even gods could save us.

00:25:02.818 --> 00:25:03.977
Move carefully,

00:25:05.697 --> 00:25:07.297
and avoid touching that kiln.

00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:14.378
Understood?

00:25:15.057 --> 00:25:16.138
Understood?

00:25:21.618 --> 00:25:22.497
Dandan?

00:25:23.257 --> 00:25:23.658
Dandan?

00:25:23.658 --> 00:25:24.497
Let's go.

00:25:36.858 --> 00:25:37.818
Young Third Master,

00:25:37.938 --> 00:25:39.537
don't look back this time.

00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:41.057
We all need to be cautious.

00:25:41.618 --> 00:25:42.658
Leave me alone.

00:25:43.017 --> 00:25:44.537
Got it. I won't look.

00:26:23.257 --> 00:26:24.777
Third Master. Third Master.

00:26:27.217 --> 00:26:28.257
There's a tunnel here.

00:26:28.898 --> 00:26:31.057
Maybe workers used it for transport?

00:26:31.457 --> 00:26:33.098
It might lead outside.

00:26:34.017 --> 00:26:35.098
I'll check it out.

00:26:35.618 --> 00:26:36.697
Be careful.

00:26:42.578 --> 00:26:43.497
Young Third Master,

00:26:43.737 --> 00:26:45.818
can you read these markings?

00:26:46.818 --> 00:26:48.737
Looks like construction records.

00:26:49.618 --> 00:26:50.618
Nothing special.

00:26:51.338 --> 00:26:53.217
Now that makes sense.

00:26:53.217 --> 00:26:54.178
I recognize this part.

00:26:54.178 --> 00:26:55.338
See? It says right here,

00:26:55.418 --> 00:26:58.658
"Kiln opening is dangerous.
Proceed with caution.

00:26:58.818 --> 00:27:02.178
Slip your hand,
and your wife will be a widow."

00:27:03.017 --> 00:27:03.977
That's what it says?

00:27:03.977 --> 00:27:05.257
Word for word.

00:27:05.497 --> 00:27:06.217
More over there.

00:27:06.217 --> 00:27:07.098
Check that side.

00:27:14.697 --> 00:27:15.777
Recognize anything?

00:27:16.297 --> 00:27:16.977
King.

00:27:17.537 --> 00:27:18.338
Soldier.

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:19.457
Village.

00:27:19.898 --> 00:27:21.297
Do you really recognize these?

00:27:22.858 --> 00:27:24.578
What does it mean when combined?

00:27:25.017 --> 00:27:26.618
Let's say I know all these characters.

00:27:26.777 --> 00:27:28.098
But there's no punctuation.

00:27:28.737 --> 00:27:30.057
And how ancient people spoke

00:27:30.057 --> 00:27:31.178
was terse.

00:27:31.618 --> 00:27:32.697
Like this word,

00:27:32.898 --> 00:27:33.697
'Indeed.'

00:27:34.497 --> 00:27:36.378
In the Qi State, there was a ruler

00:27:36.578 --> 00:27:38.098
who asked his strategist a question.

00:27:38.098 --> 00:27:39.578
The strategist only replied,

00:27:39.737 --> 00:27:41.418
"Indeed."

00:27:43.098 --> 00:27:43.537
And then?

00:27:43.537 --> 00:27:44.418
Then,

00:27:44.418 --> 00:27:46.378
the ruler got completely confused.

00:27:46.378 --> 00:27:48.378
He pondered for ages
but couldn't figure out

00:27:48.457 --> 00:27:50.178
what this 'Indeed' truly meant.

00:27:50.178 --> 00:27:51.658
Was it agreement or disagreement?

00:27:51.938 --> 00:27:53.217
It stressed him into illness.

00:27:53.578 --> 00:27:54.457
In the end,

00:27:55.017 --> 00:27:56.777
when the ruler was dying,

00:27:56.777 --> 00:27:58.537
he went back to ask the strategist

00:27:58.537 --> 00:28:00.297
what it truly meant.

00:28:00.457 --> 00:28:02.138
The strategist simply repeated...

00:28:02.138 --> 00:28:03.057
"Indeed."

00:28:04.457 --> 00:28:06.297
The ruler died right then.

00:28:07.818 --> 00:28:08.777
He's up there.

00:28:09.017 --> 00:28:09.737
Pan Zi.

00:28:12.297 --> 00:28:12.977
Why do you think

00:28:13.338 --> 00:28:13.898
Xiaoge

00:28:13.898 --> 00:28:15.938
can talk to whatever's in the kiln?

00:28:15.938 --> 00:28:17.497
Is there a zombie inside?

00:28:17.618 --> 00:28:18.658
Hard to say.

00:28:19.578 --> 00:28:20.858
But Third Master once said

00:28:21.138 --> 00:28:22.017
that guy

00:28:22.297 --> 00:28:24.818
can mimic any sound with a ghost whistle

00:28:24.818 --> 00:28:26.057
to communicate with creatures.

00:28:26.737 --> 00:28:28.138
If he's an ally,

00:28:28.138 --> 00:28:29.818
we gain advantages.

00:28:30.057 --> 00:28:31.737
But if he turns hostile,

00:28:31.737 --> 00:28:33.257
real trouble starts.

00:28:35.457 --> 00:28:37.418
But the thing in that kiln...

00:28:37.418 --> 00:28:38.537
The bloody soil.

00:28:39.178 --> 00:28:41.658
The bloody soil we dug up earlier

00:28:41.658 --> 00:28:42.938
must be connected.

00:28:43.898 --> 00:28:47.418
I just hope that guy
really negotiated a success.

00:28:50.618 --> 00:28:51.418
Third Master.

00:28:51.618 --> 00:28:52.418
No way out.

00:28:53.178 --> 00:28:54.537
It's sheer cliffs above.

00:28:54.537 --> 00:28:55.578
There's no way down.

00:28:55.938 --> 00:28:56.898
Come down now.

00:28:58.378 --> 00:28:59.297
Where's Xiaoge?

00:29:00.497 --> 00:29:01.777
Quick, follow him.

00:29:02.737 --> 00:29:03.457
Da Kui,

00:29:03.457 --> 00:29:05.618
we're moving ahead. Catch up.

00:29:07.938 --> 00:29:08.618
Third Uncle.

00:29:09.057 --> 00:29:09.658
Third Uncle.

00:29:10.578 --> 00:29:12.057
What's this passage for?

00:29:12.497 --> 00:29:14.017
Likely a material transport tunnel.

00:29:14.017 --> 00:29:15.297
It probably connects everywhere

00:29:16.138 --> 00:29:17.378
throughout the kiln complex.

00:29:17.378 --> 00:29:18.818
Xiaoge is moving too fast.

00:29:18.818 --> 00:29:19.658
Let's keep up.

00:29:38.017 --> 00:29:38.777
Third Master.

00:29:39.457 --> 00:29:40.618
This path's useless.

00:29:41.178 --> 00:29:43.777
There is a drop
of hundreds of meters outside.

00:29:48.138 --> 00:29:49.658
Fall means pancake landing.

00:29:57.017 --> 00:29:57.777
Third Master?

00:30:00.977 --> 00:30:01.777
Pan Zi?

00:30:02.898 --> 00:30:04.057
Young Third Master?

00:30:09.938 --> 00:30:10.898
Da Kui.

00:30:12.658 --> 00:30:13.618
Over here.

00:30:28.017 --> 00:30:28.658
Third Master.

00:30:29.098 --> 00:30:30.217
Outside are cliffs.

00:30:30.378 --> 00:30:31.537
Climbing out means death.

00:30:33.737 --> 00:30:35.497
This place wasn't meant for exits.

00:30:38.737 --> 00:30:39.578
Xiaoge,

00:30:40.057 --> 00:30:41.017
Da Kui's here.

00:30:42.217 --> 00:30:42.898
Let's go.

00:30:56.618 --> 00:30:58.098
We've reached the core zone.

00:31:23.537 --> 00:31:24.418
Sir,

00:31:25.178 --> 00:31:27.338
that young master says it's the core.

00:31:27.457 --> 00:31:29.057
I... I can't go in.

00:31:29.578 --> 00:31:31.578
Call me if you find an exit.

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:34.098
Don't wander off.

00:31:58.658 --> 00:31:59.457
Third Master,

00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:01.297
this place feels off.

00:32:02.418 --> 00:32:03.618
Halt for now.

00:32:04.017 --> 00:32:05.418
Search this area thoroughly.

00:32:06.178 --> 00:32:07.257
Gather intel

00:32:07.497 --> 00:32:09.658
to determine our next move.

00:32:21.017 --> 00:32:22.658
No animal carcasses here.

00:32:24.098 --> 00:32:25.497
Sealed surroundings.

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:33.098
It's probably safe.

00:32:33.098 --> 00:32:34.257
We can rest.

00:32:35.898 --> 00:32:37.178
Can we eat?

00:32:37.378 --> 00:32:38.217
No.

00:32:49.977 --> 00:32:50.818
Third Uncle,

00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:52.297
what are these?

00:32:53.217 --> 00:32:54.697
The roots of Dragon-Subduing Trees.

00:32:58.057 --> 00:32:59.578
You even know about this, Third Uncle?

00:33:01.658 --> 00:33:02.497
Don't touch anything.

00:33:02.658 --> 00:33:03.898
Something is inside the trees.

00:33:07.098 --> 00:33:08.497
It looks like these roots

00:33:08.697 --> 00:33:10.257
are encasing an alchemy furnace.

00:33:10.257 --> 00:33:11.697
Yes, it's indeed an alchemy furnace.

00:33:12.578 --> 00:33:13.618
But do you know why

00:33:13.618 --> 00:33:15.178
they planted trees over the furnace?

00:33:16.658 --> 00:33:17.418
Why?

00:33:17.977 --> 00:33:19.697
Trees represent Wood
of the Five Elements.

00:33:20.057 --> 00:33:22.537
They grow, root, and propagate.

00:33:23.217 --> 00:33:24.737
They symbolize the source of life.

00:33:25.457 --> 00:33:28.457
Their vital energy purifies the mind.

00:33:30.618 --> 00:33:31.737
So ancient people believed

00:33:31.737 --> 00:33:33.297
trees can transform things.

00:33:34.297 --> 00:33:35.777
Then why are we resting here?

00:33:36.057 --> 00:33:36.977
Let's get moving.

00:33:37.138 --> 00:33:38.658
There are trees here.

00:33:39.497 --> 00:33:40.418
These trees

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:42.497
already purified this place long ago.

00:33:46.217 --> 00:33:47.138
That can't be right.

00:33:47.418 --> 00:33:48.697
It's supposed to be a kiln.

00:33:49.138 --> 00:33:50.858
Why is there an alchemy furnace?

00:33:51.418 --> 00:33:52.138
Kiln?

00:33:52.898 --> 00:33:54.457
You know better than me?

00:33:54.858 --> 00:33:55.497
Get lost.

00:33:56.338 --> 00:33:57.098
Young Third Master.

00:33:59.578 --> 00:34:00.658
Got an earful, didn't you?

00:34:01.697 --> 00:34:02.418
Come here.

00:34:03.057 --> 00:34:04.818
Have you forgotten
Third Master's teachings?

00:34:04.818 --> 00:34:06.737
Always survey a new location first.

00:34:06.737 --> 00:34:08.738
A quick mind can earn you
a quick fist sometimes.

00:34:08.738 --> 00:34:10.938
And stop obsessing over one detail.

00:34:10.938 --> 00:34:12.698
New questions emerge
when you shift focus.

00:34:12.938 --> 00:34:13.778
Look.

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:41.938
Lv Dandan?

00:35:44.738 --> 00:35:45.577
Lv Dandan?

00:35:48.617 --> 00:35:49.497
Lv Dandan?

00:35:56.218 --> 00:35:57.057
Lv Dandan?

00:35:57.938 --> 00:35:58.858
Lv Dandan?

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:00.577
Lv Dandan?
